<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>TO hope to understand in a few short years or
even in a lifetime the development of the
humane, refined, and notably progressive people of
Japan would be presumptuous; yet, if I can in these
pages contribute in some degree toward that end, I
shall feel amply rewarded.</p>

<p class="indent">I am indebted to those who have preceded me in
this field for much of my detail. I shall, moreover,
always hold that to my Japanese friends and others,
who so cheerfully rendered me assistance in obtaining
original matter, should be attributed any merit which
this tale of old Japan may possess. Without them it
could not have been, and for its shortcomings I alone
am responsible.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<p class="indent">That to the new the old must yield had ever been
exemplified in Japan, as elsewhere, though until
the time of this narrative she had not chosen earnestly
to measure the test outside the confines of her own
borders. The flowery kingdom of Nippon[<a href="#index1">1</a><a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a>] did not
know the world as others knew it, nor had she as yet
cared to know it, for she was occupied and contented
within her own sphere, hence satisfied and progressive
without coming into contact with another
civilisation.</p>

<p class="indent">In love as in law this kindly civil and quaintly constituted
people had been moved and swayed, governed
and ruled, by the one master spirit, ancestor
worship, as marriage was contracted and government
prosecuted in accordance with its divine precepts.
Regardless of mutual love or natural affinity, the
family in its official capacity chose for the husband a
wife; and without its decree there was no release,
though love was the basic element of their social
existence.</p>

<p class="indent">For better or for worse this condition prevailed and
would have controlled the destinies of Shibusawa, as
it had those before him, had not a new spirit risen
within and possessed him as well as others with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg&nbsp;x]</span>
whom he was to become related. At the birth of
this young prince, which occurred in the month of
April, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1834, Maido, his father, was the lord
daimyo[<a href="#index2">2</a><a name="fn2" id="fn2"></a>] of Kanazawa prefecture, comprising the
then wealthy and prosperous provinces of Kaga,
Echigen, Sado, Echigo, Wakasa, Etchu, and Noto, in
the northwestern part of Japan. It was the largest
and most powerful of the shogun&#146;s[<a href="#index3">3</a><a name="fn3" id="fn3"></a>] many prefectures,
and Maido was the last in succession of one of
the longest unbroken lines of royal daimyos: under
the shogun, he was an undisputed ruler, and his
people were among the most progressive and peaceful
in the land.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, as elsewhere, the lord daimyo knew no law
except of his own making; always subject, however,
to the dictates of an inborn religion and the payment
of just dues to his recognised superior, the shogun.
Within the prefecture was the daimyo&#146;s estate and
the source of his material support, and though
Tokyo, the shogun&#146;s capital city, was decreed his
legal residence, his prefectural land was the place of
his birth and succession, his principal home, and the
real seat of his power. Yet with all his wealth and
influence and character, that he, too, as we shall see,
must inevitably bow is the unalterable law of progress.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br/>
THE CHRISTENING</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_001.jpg" width="197" height="359" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Maido</span>, the lord daimyo, came
strolling, late one May day, along
a pebbled pathway in his castle
grounds at Kanazawa, and while
doing so he caught a last glimpse
of the great red sun as it slowly
sank toward the western horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What a glorious sunset!&#148;
said he to himself, as he halted
and breathed deeply the sweetened
air that floated by, lazily
flagging the cherry and cypress
trees standing here and there in
the garden about him.</p>

<p class="indent">He paused only a moment, and then slowly approached
the family mansion, where he cast his
sandals upon the flagstone and bounded upon the
polished veranda with a vigour that bespoke a well-preserved
age at fifty or more. Once in the house
he quietly proceeded to the great chamber and softly
clapped his hands, whereupon a servant noiselessly
approached, bowed low, and held for his convenience
a silken kimono,[<a href="#index4">4</a><a name="fn4" id="fn4"></a>] which he donned and folded in front.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
Having thus clad himself he turned his back upon
Kimon (the Gate of Demons, or northwest comer of
the room), crossed his toes under him, and squatted
upon the soft, matted floor.</p>

<p class="indent">A second call brought another servant who placed
on the floor in front of him a lacquered brazier filled
with live coals, a tobacco tray with tobacco, and a
little metal pipe with a long bamboo stem. Maido
then sat there, quiet and alone, smoking and wondering,
and looking out over the glistening waters
at the beautiful sunset, until his eyes closed and his
head nodded, and perchance he dreamed of the
glories yet to befall the great and good house of
Kanazawa.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently a sliding partition softly opened and
there stole to his side a little butterfly whose fairy-like
steps did not awaken him and whose presence
was unheeded until she cautiously whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Heigh! my lord, my daimyo, am I welcome, that
I come?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Heigh! my wife, my Kakezara, I trust it may
not be other than welcome now that you have chanced
to come without Maido&#146;s permission.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Even so, my honourable master, I present you
with a child, born erstwhile the seventh day.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then have you no better words than these? You
know well my wishes. Seven wives have I married
and do now give shelter within this splendid castle.
To you, the last, is well known my wish, my hope,
my command. It is well that you bow low, for if
the word be spoken falsely, and speak you shall,
then will I unsheathe the sword of Amanosakohoko
and bury the tempered steel deep in your heaving
breast. No, I will not so degrade you, but will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
sentence you to harakiri[<a href="#index5">5</a><a name="fn5" id="fn5"></a>]&#151;a death and punishment
more befitting your stupid self, for it is a great
sin to disobey your lord and master. But speak
the word, and truly, and I will raise up your blushing
face and mete you the proudest and grandest within my
gift. Speak as I command, Kakezara, and you shall
be the choice of my heart, the queen of my household.
All other wives shall be as servants and shall respond
to your bidding. Of kimonos you shall have without
number. Your chair shall be inlaid with mother-of-pearl
and lacquered with pure gold from the mines
of Sado. Sweets suited to your taste shall be made
of the best and purest. Speak, O Kakezara, and you
shall henceforth reign queen of Maido&#146;s household.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My lord, my daimyo, then I would that it were
not true, for I cannot undo that which is done even
though I am to suffer the ills of an unhappy lot:
position is a husband&#146;s due, then a wife&#146;s happiness.
By the spirit of my ancestors and the grace of the
gods your command has been obeyed&#151;it is a son.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ebisu! Ebisu! O Ebisu! god of good luck, how
Maido is this day honoured and the gods pleased! for
it is my command that he be named Shibusawa, and
it is the will of Jimmu that he rise up to good and
mighty deeds. Rise, Kakezara, my queen, and place
the child in the arms of Okisan; and you, slave, take
care that your charge receive due attention that he
may grow up strong of body and mind, for so sure
as he live he shall be tried by all the gods of hatred
and woe. I charge you that no morsel be given him
except by your hand, for should ill befall this my
child then beware of the ancestral demons who dwell
at the shrine of Jigoko.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Kakezara, my lady, proceed to the inner chamber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and there remain in strict seclusion until coolies
have fetched water from the river Yamato in which
to bathe; for as you live you have a secret, and until
strengthened by the spiritual waters the temptation
to divulge might overcome your desire to obey. I
have imparted to you something of that which the
gods have willed Shibusawa, that a mother&#146;s love
and solicitude may the better shield his tender years.
Keep it sacred under pain of displeasing your husband
and provoking the wrath of Oni, for as it has pleased
me that you obeyed so let it please you to obey.
Hence, my lady, my Kakezara.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yendo, ass that you are, pretending ancestral
birth befitting to serve a lord daimyo so good and
great as I, come hither and bow low before the
father of Shibusawa. Go carry Maido&#146;s command
to the temple of Yeiheiji that seven times seven
solemn strokes be sounded, calling upon the spirit of
Amaterasu to awaken, that she may welcome the
new born. Send swift running messengers to notify
all the people that Maido, their lord and master, is
the father of a son, christened Shibusawa, whom it
has pleased the gods shall rule his ancestral heritage
in obedience to the dictates of his own conscience
and with honour to his majesty&#146;s shogun. Cause to be
hung above the entrance to every house red and
yellow lanterns that all may take notice, for to those
who remain ignorant shall appear spirits mounted
upon dragons with eyes of fire and nostrils belching
clouds of flame and smoke, as they charge down
through the heavens toward Ema-O.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Convey to the people my command that from the
new to the old moon, following next, none shall eat
more than half his allowance of rice or drink more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
than half his sake, bringing the remainder to their
daimyo&#146;s storehouse that a great feast may be indulged.
They shall also bring of their silk one-half
and of their potted flowers many, that Kakezara, the
noble mother, may have kimonos without number
and her gardens may be filled with beauty and fragrance.
Those engaged in the making of sweets
shall make such as will please her taste, and beware
that none displease, for better that ten thousand
times ten thousand slaves perish at their labour than
Kakezara, queen of Maido&#146;s household, be not served
without the slightest displeasure. Let the most
famed of workers in wood and lacquer be called
together that they may counsel with one another
about the making for Kakezara a chair; and, as I
myself have taught them well in this art, let all
beware that when the work is done there be none
other so good; for I shall not be so base as to spare
even one who shall in the least manner slight his labour
or fail in his part.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I command that the governor of each province
select the fairest daughters from among his kinsmen,
that there may assemble at the shibai (place of
amusement), during the first moon of the iris and the
lotus, not less than seven times seventy-seven virgins
with rosy complexions and pleasing manners, for the
goddess Benten has willed Maido the pleasures of at
least three moons. Tell the household keeper to
make ready chambers fronting on gardens filled with
the perfume of flowers and the song of birds, and,
when the hour has come, to assemble these fairies in
the silken hall of love, that their lord daimyo, like
Jimmu of old, may descend the f&#234;ted stair into a
world of beauty and pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
&#147;And when all else has been done you will instruct
him that henceforth Kakezara shall occupy the
choicest pillow at the head of Maido&#146;s lawful wives,
and that of them her voice shall be first in authority:
that her rank at bath shall be next to Shibusawa&#146;s
and first among her sex.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The news of Shibusawa&#146;s birth and christening
soon spread, and the excitement wore heavily from
the meanest coolie to Maido himself, though probably
none was more worried than Yukesan, the oldest and
meanest servant in the household. This faithful old
slave had climbed daily, for seven successive days
before the christening, to the top of Onnasaka, and
each time as often bumped her head upon the cold
hard stone at the base of Kishemogin&#146;s tomb, praying
for the goddess mother of fiends to come and
claim the new born. For seven months prior thereto
even, she had importuned this fiendish goddess to
render Maido&#146;s lawful wives incapable of bearing a
male child, hoping that her own fatherless imp,
Okyo,&#151;now seven years of age, with slight form
and stooped shoulders, his eyes small and his head
peaked, whose hair stood out like bristles on a porcupine,
while his nose looked owlish and his ears as a
squirrel&#146;s,&#151;might naturally be adopted and thus
become the inheritor of his master&#146;s rank and place.</p>

<p class="indent">The rest of the household busied themselves with
the day&#146;s rounds or discussing the probable change
at the castle, for little were they interested in outside
affairs. They were not concerned with the possible
new daimyo&#146;s bearing upon the welfare at large, for
they were destitute of power to aid, hence without
any inclination to heed; where the only hope in life
was to do the bidding of a master. Each courted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
his own content and permitted others likewise to
suffer or adapt their own circumstances. They were
an independent lot, hence their abject dependence.</p>

<p class="indent">When, therefore, the hour for feasting had arrived,
and each little tray, hustled in and set upon the floor
in front of the person served, was seen to contain a
small satsuma bowl, filled with a rare delicacy&#151;consisting
of real live worms (a kind of salt water shrimp),
wriggling and crawling, and served only upon extraordinary
occasions&#151;everybody accounted his
master a noble of the royal blood. Eating, smoking,
and drinking were interspersed with a lagging conversation
until the last was stretched at length upon
the spotless matting, his only place of sleeping.
Maido, too, had gone to sleep at an early hour, and
when he awakened the next morning he felt refreshed,
and was well pleased with a recollection of
preceding events. Without rising, he reclined on his
elbow and looked out at the landscape around, for
early in the morning servants had noiselessly removed
the outer partitions so that their master could lounge
on the floor and enjoy the open air at his pleasure.
This morning the sun&#146;s rays seemed to give a little
more warmth than usual, and as they fell amongst
the green foliage the large drops of dew reflected
sparkling gems that lolled on the hollow leaflets, or
trickled down the long and bended blades of grass.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What a glorious world, and how sweet to live
in!&#148; thought he, as he lay there revelling in the
beauties of art and nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Strong and vigorous of body, mind, and heart, as
only those are who are at peace with the world, he
arose and briskly crossed the room to the inner
veranda. Then, casting off his night kimono, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
lightly tripped down upon a marble slab, and running
along the smooth footpath to an arbour, overhung with
vine and flower, plunged into the bracing waters
already prepared for his coming. After the bath,
massage, and shave, attended by waiting servants,
he donned walking apparel and sprang down along
the winding walk among dwarfed trees, under artificial
cliffs, and around miniature mountains; here
he crossed a red-lacquered bridge and there passed
a gorge or waterfall; coming, presently, to a crystal
lake, he made an unsuccessful throw or two, then cast
his rod aside and continued his tramp in the open or
through the brush and bamboo to a distant corner
of the garden. Here he slackened his gait and with
reverence approached the solemn shrine wherein
stood the tomb of Hajama, the illustrious founder
of his august family; and there, in the quiet, and
alone, at the base of this strangely carved monument,
he knelt and clapped his hands and reverently bowed
to the spirit of his immortal ancestor.</p>

<p class="indent">When his morning prayer was finished Maido
quietly left the misty place and walked out again into
the freshness of life and past the playground where
groups of children romped on the green or chattered
with childish glee. As he passed them by he paused
only to look at them for a moment and then walked
on toward the great gate in front. Now and then
he stooped to pluck a leaflet, or stood listening to the
tuneful zephyrs as they played among the branches;
sometimes he stopped to watch the light and shadows
chase each other across the grassy sward, or started
at the sonorous, &#147;Haugh! Haugh! Haugh!&#148; wafted
from high overhead.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Truly he is the master bird,&#148; sighed he, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
watched the black thing perching upon a lofty branch
or soaring above, issuing his harrowing notes and
stirring the nerves of superstitious Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently, as usual upon such occasions, Okyo
emerged from a cluster of bushes and came bowing
and bumping and crawling&#151;half confident, half
fearful&#151;after his master; who now stood admiring
the huge wisteria which overhung the black-lacquered
gate and bronze trimmings. Observing the boy&#146;s
presence, Maido said, kindly, and without turning
around:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Heigh! is that you, Okyo, my funny little slave?
Pray tell me what brings you here so early in the
day?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Heigh! I thought you might be lonely and I&#146;d
come and drive away the fox.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But, my lad, what have you been doing that your
kimono is wet and covered with mud?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ve been down at the beach fishing for crabs.
I wonder why Kami doesn&#146;t make crabs grow on
land?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My child, he has placed them in the waters of
the deep sea so that none but the industrious and
the brave may enjoy so choice a food.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Are daimyos industrious and brave?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Maido made no answer to the boy&#146;s inquiry but
turned toward the fragrant vine, and stood admiring
the bright foliage, possibly dreaming of the future
of his son and heir, until Okyo once more began
chattering.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Heigh! great master, please why is the vine so
large and beautiful?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Heigh! Okyo, it is because our ancestral gods
have so created it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
&#147;But why do not the gods create vines so large
and so beautiful for all men?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Because, my child, all men are not given to such
beauty.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Are all daimyos inclined toward only that which
is beautiful?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes. They are descended from the gods of
goodness and love, and as the spirits of these gods
dwell in the realms of heavenly beauty so do the
minds of daimyos dwell upon things of earthly
beauty.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;If daimyos think and do only things which are
beautiful, why do they cut men&#146;s heads off?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That is done in obedience to the commands of our
superiors; and, I assure you, there is nothing more
beautiful than an act of obedience to our masters.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Will Shibusawa be a daimyo when he grows up?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; if his head be spared so long and his father&#146;s
not.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Will I, too, be a daimyo when I am a man?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, child. How came you to think of such a
thing?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Because mother says I look like Shibusawa, and
I don&#146;t see why I shouldn&#146;t be just like him.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You shall be Shibusawa&#146;s friend and confidant.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why shall I be his friend and confidant?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Because you will comfort and console him during
moments of contemplation and despair, just as you
have myself since you were first able to tread about
my gardens on wooden stilts.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why will I comfort and console him?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Because you are the son of&#151;only a mother,
who is of Kishemogin and possessed of less wit and
more cunning than a fox. Now then, hie you away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
to your mother&#146;s mat and feast well upon rice and
fish so that you may grow strong in endurance, for
you shall have many and severe trials in following
this youth ere he has much passed your age.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh,&#148; said Maido, to himself, &#147;see him run away
in obedience to my command! There is not yet a
twig so crooked or a thing so small but it can be
made of use. As the mould is shaped so will be the
cast. He is of the right material. I shall see that
he grows up after my liking, bend him to the task
properly, and thus provide the instrument through
which Shibusawa may acquit himself of the
thankless duties imposed by Bishamon, god of
provocation.&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br/>
EARLY LIFE</h2>

<p class="indent">From the recording of Shibusawa&#146;s birth in the
Keidzu, the daimyo&#146;s great book, until he had
passed sixteen (the average age of discretion in Japan),
there was but little in his life that is of interest so
far as this story is concerned. Maido was always
solicitous about the child&#146;s care, and took every
precaution to have him taught only such ideas as
were in accord with his ancestors&#146; and the preconceived
notions of the shogun&#146;s government.</p>

<p class="indent">The son inherited from his father much of his
stalwartness and determination, and from his mother
something of those finer qualities, tenderness and
forbearance, which combined at an early age to
quicken in him a deeper sense and insure a broader
scope of life. He evinced at an early age an untiring
devotion to his studies and to a research for truth;
and all the many castle buildings were soon even more
familiar to him than to Maido, and he knew well
the history, the uses, and the purposes of each. The
castle ramparts were his playgrounds, and each
swordsman and every archer was a slave indeed.</p>

<p class="indent">Either in company or alone he had traversed all
the macadam roads, leading from village to village
and province to province; and in palace or house,
from city to country, he knew the people and they
knew him, and as he grew older they learned to love
and respect him as they did Maido himself. Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
was he content with what he saw and heard at home,
but as he grew he began to thirst for a knowledge of
the outer world; though in this he had been discreet
as regards his father, for however ambitious his desires
he had not once expressed a wish. Maido knew
too well that there were more peace and contentment
and less crime and misery at home than elsewhere,
and very wisely wished his son to be kept from too
close a discernment until he had arrived at maturer
years.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa&#146;s desire to go, however, finally grew into
a determination. Whereupon, as was usual in such
matters, he took Okyo into his confidence, at least
to the extent of consulting him how best to frustrate
his father without disobeying him. Now Okyo
reasoned that as Shibusawa had not asked the privilege
of going he had never been admonished to stay;
so, after consulting Fudo, god of enlightenment, thus
easing his conscience, he advised that it was best to
make ready and go, without endangering their
chances by asking permission of anybody.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa, though doubtful of its propriety,
readily conceded the wisdom of Okyo&#146;s reasoning,
for above all other things he would not disobey:
strategy, while not characteristic of him, he deemed
the proper thing, as it was no more an inborn
trait than a national virtue. Early that autumn,
accordingly, he began to curtail his expenses as much
as he could without arousing suspicion, and to save
from his allowance a fund with which to defray the
cost of their contemplated trip. The time of starting
was a difficult thing to determine, as under ordinary
circumstances Shibusawa was almost certain to be
recognised while passing the gates, and unless a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
good reason was apparent to the guards such a circumstance
would have been immediately reported to
the castle. Here Okyo again displayed his judgment
by advising the day after Nobori-iche, boys&#146; festival
(May 5th), it being the day upon which Maido would
start upon his regular visit into the country. This
trip generally lasted from two to four weeks, and ever
since Shibusawa&#146;s birth the starting had been put off
until this particular date,&#151;as often, when the boy
had grown older, he was taken along; yet his going
was never compulsory or even urged against his
pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">When the allotted time came Shibusawa again
started off with his father and suite, but before they
had gone far he suddenly changed his mind and
pleaded to be allowed to return. Maido, though disappointed
in the loss of his son&#146;s company and not
the least suspicious of a serious motive, readily granted
permission, and Shibusawa lost no time in joining
Okyo at a certain agreed place, where the former
quickly changed his silken kimono and lacquered
shoes for the regular dress of a pilgrim, while the latter
with less trouble donned the same kind of garb.
Thus disguised they passed through the city and
escaped into the country, in a direction opposite to
that taken by his father, and travelled along unmolested
until they had gone entirely out of Maido&#146;s
domain and into the territory of a hostile neighbour.</p>

<p class="indent">Having thus placed himself beyond pursuit,
Shibusawa despatched a message to his father explaining
fully his intentions and assuring him of his safety.
Maido was, thereupon, overwhelmed with anxiety,
yet he made no attempt to follow. He realised that
his only hope of seeing him again lay in the boy&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
own discretion and voluntary return; pursuit would
have been the means of disclosing his identity to a
bitter and jealous rival, and thenceforth he must be
in danger of death and possible torture.</p>

<p class="indent">The getting off without discovery had so occupied
and stimulated Shibusawa that he had as yet given
but little thought to the dangers and hardships
which confronted him. True, he was acquainted
with laws and customs at home, and was not altogether
unfamiliar with those in force elsewhere, yet
he quickly discovered that the spirit and regulations
in a country continually at war are necessarily very
different from those of one where quiet and industry
prevail. However, he had set out for a definite purpose
and he did not mean to lose courage, nor let any
obstacle stand in the way of accomplishing what he
had undertaken. He had chosen the one disguise
that would make excuse and enable him to pass
through the country, provided he travelled from
temple to temple and shrine to shrine, the proper
business of a pilgrim. And as Okyo had had at
home some experience of this kind he at first relied
upon him to lead the way and avoid any serious conflict
with the numerous police, guards, and spies who
infested the region which they were about to explore.
He trusted to his father&#146;s good judgment to make no
attempt to follow; yet to be entirely safe he chose, for
the moment, to avoid Kyoto, and the more noted
shrines of that locality, and to keep to the westward
and overland toward Shimonoseki and Nagasaki, in
the extreme west and south.</p>

<p class="indent">Wandering about almost at will and without undue
interference they visited all of the principal shrines
and places, including, on the return trip, Kyoto, Nara,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
and Kamakura in the far east. It was now almost
Kawabisaki, the Day of the Opening of the River
(July twenty-fifth)&#151;at Tokyo, the residence seat
of the shogun&#151;and as Shibusawa had never witnessed
a celebration of the local autumn holiday he
very much desired to join in the coming festivities.
Hence by special effort and by hastily passing some
of the minor places of interest they reached the capital
city late on the second day preceding the gala ceremonies.</p>

<p class="indent">They were surprised upon their arrival, however,
to find that they were none too soon, and that the
rush of pilgrims and traders already made it difficult
of obtaining quarters close to the main entrance
at the palace grounds, the much coveted place of
rendezvous. As their expenses had hitherto been
even lighter than expected, Shibusawa was still provided
with ready funds, and he now proposed to get
as near the main approach as he could without seeming
impertinent, and as a matter of convenience, as
well as respect, to secure the best accommodations
consistent with their apparent stations. Thus they
finally established themselves at the Look-See tea
house, a favourite hostelry for the better class of pilgrims,
and were assigned quarters on the top floor
plainly in view of the gates and directly on the line
of march.</p>

<p class="indent">This noted caravansary did not differ much from
the rest of the two-storied open-sided thatch-roofed
houses resembling hay-stacks on stilts that lined
both sides of the narrow streets which emerged
closely from the outer entrance at the palace enclosure.
Within the house, in the broad and airy tea
rooms below, or on the soft matted floors above, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
jolly transient and sometimes happy wits would sit
or lounge discussing, over a cup of tea or a bowl of
sake, the topics of the day or the gossip of their particular
neighbourhood. Without, the brilliant lights,
the gaily dressed, the sound of the koto,[<a href="#index6">6</a><a name="fn6" id="fn6"></a>] the song of
the geishas,[<a href="#index7">7</a><a name="fn7" id="fn7"></a>] the clatter of shoes, the parley of tradesmen,
the chatter of voices, the endless round of life
from early morning till late at night, might well have
turned the heads and emptied the pockets of the
thirsty throngs who ever crowded the happy-go-lucky
place. Much of all this could be distinctly seen and
heard from Shibusawa&#146;s apartments in the second
story, fronting the plaza, nor did he lose an opportunity,
for he was there to see and learn as well as to
rest and enjoy himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus he remained quiet and observant, without
venturing upon the street, until the evening of the
second day after their arrival. In the meantime
Okyo had been sent out to reconnoitre the principal
places and the liveliest dancing girls, in which he was
materially assisted by an Osaka merchant who occupied
an adjoining room. Thereupon, after a sup at
the restaurant and a quiet smoke on the floor, they
all sauntered off in quest of such pleasures and excitement
as the night might afford.</p>

<p class="indent">As this was the last night before the grand parade
the streets were unusually crowded and the buying
was brisk. Now more than at any other time the
servants and retainers and their families were permitted
to come outside the walled enclosure and into
the streets in quest of trinkets and gewgaws with
which to ornament and bedeck themselves on the following
day; the chance to elbow these favoured ones,
probably more than a desire to buy, brought there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
many of the city&#146;s curiously inclined; the opportunity
afforded the guests, emptied the numerous inns; and
all together, when mingled under myriads of bright
lanterns, amid the tinsel and the noise, it was a sight
most glaring and intensely interesting.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa and Okyo had edged their way along
for some time and until they had passed through the
main shopping districts and into the nokodos&#146; (marriage
brokers&#146;) quarters, with its barren little stalls,
narrow doors, and large gaudy sign-poles projecting
like charred remnants of a burned brush patch. Here
there were girls in silks and girls in rags, all being
dragged alike, one after another, in long rows, by
mothers in need of ready cash, before the several
nokodos, who were each and all haggling and quarrelling
over the price of this or the qualities of that one;
always closing the bargain if closed at all with some
ejaculation expressing great sorrow at having paid
too much or received too little for the &#147;honourable
unhandsome one.&#148; Shibusawa looked on for a while
not so much at the formality, for that was a common
thing, but at the attitude of the parties, which impressed
him deeply. He could understand the
brokers&#146; motive, as there are always those who are
designed to thrive on the weakness or misfortune of
others&#151;especially when the law makes such a business
legitimate or possible. The mothers he divined
to be mostly the victims of too generous self-indulgence;
who were now hardened by necessity and
excused by custom. But the daughters&#151;why their
complacency? Was it a decree of law or of love that
caused these young maidens, some of them beautiful,
attractive, or intelligent, to exercise the most stoical
indifference while the mother was bargaining them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
off at the best price obtainable? As Shibusawa
passed them by, or stood and looked, his heart
throbbed and he almost said aloud:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Can this be God&#146;s will?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Moving on with some difficulty they soon came to
a place a trifle more pretentious than others, where
they unconsciously entered and pushed their way
close to the nokodo who sat on the floor at the opposite
side of the room. After several offerings had
been scanned and pinched and jostled, then bought
or passed, a middle-aged woman of more than ordinary
presence first hesitated, then advanced and
bowed to the bejewelled broker, whose keen, sharp
eyes squinted under a narrow, wrinkled brow. A rosy-cheeked,
innocent young daughter of fourteen stood
nestled at her mother&#146;s side, blushing, though erect.
Shibusawa stood contemplating not the persons but
the act, and when the mother had made her best
plea and was about to accept the price offered his
strong frame shook, his face whitened, and he resolutely
said in a clear voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No; I will give you three hundred yens (dollars)
besides an additional one hundred to bear the
charge.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The nokodo was more than pleased to get the
lawful commission without assuming any risk, and
in consequence drew up the proper bill of sale from
Torimas, mother of Shiyoganai, to Shibusawa, a
pilgrim.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been specified and provided that Shibusawa
should be the lawful owner of Shiyoganai for a period
of three years from that date, and that in consideration
of the extra one hundred yens the child should
remain the charge of her mother. When properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
signed, sealed, and delivered Shibusawa paid over
the money and carefully folded the document
inside his girdle, while he and Okyo then went
their way and the mother and daughter returned to
their home.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br/>
MEETING WITH KINSAN</h2>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa returned to his lodgings shortly after
midnight, and soon lay down to sleep. He had
seen more of the gay side of life than ever before, and
though in a measure not averse to it he was deeply
impressed with some of the incidents, which he
thought unnecessary if not vicious. And now that
the revelry was dying out and the night regaining
its quietude he slept soundly until a late hour. When
he arose he pushed back the sliding partition, and
a warm burst of sunlight streamed into the room;
the air was balmy, and the once deserted streets were
again taking on renewed life; the brocaded hillside
across the moat in front, with its samurai huts and
maple trees, waved and sparkled with a thousand
tints. It was a joyous morning, and Shibusawa ate
and drank to his content as he sat and watched the
oncoming of the day&#146;s festivities.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not long to wait, though, for Iyeyoshi,
twelfth Shogun, was more noted for his ceremonious
punctuality than for his official dignity; there had
been so little of importance to mark the shogunate
for more than a century that each incumbent had
become rather indifferent to everything except pomp
and show. Therefore the procession began to move
promptly at twelve o&#146;clock, and in less than an hour
the chair of state came up to the inner gate and
halted&#151;as did also each detachment, before crossing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
over into the profane world&#151;so that his royal
highness might bow and pray the gods for a happy
going and safe return. Details of soldiery and squads
of officials, interspersed with symbolic banners and
huge floats, were aligned according to birth and rank,
and as they moved along, strange incantations or
lamentations arose above the din of discordant instruments
and the loud shouts of excited men, who
leaped in the air or threw themselves upon the earth
in wild exultation.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa sat and watched the long procession
slacken and start with each recurring interruption,
until a temporary pause brought to a standstill
directly opposite to him a high float which was arranged
like a pyramid and covered with flowers,
shrubs, and vines. Amid the lotus blossoms in the
centre there sat a young maiden not more than fifteen,
who wore a crown of maple leaves and did her hair
in a manner to indicate that she was yet unmarried.
Her hair was black and abundant, and set beautifully
a rosy face in which a pair of large dark eyes betokened
tenderness, if a little serious. Her kimono was
of soft but plain material and folded gracefully about
her, and she quietly sat there the queen of the shogun&#146;s
garden, though only the daughter of its keeper. She
did not turn this way or that as others did to attract
attention, but modestly looked at the beautiful
things around her, thinking only of the honours due
to her kind and beneficent shogun, for whom she was
then being privileged to do homage.</p>

<p class="indent">It was while her attention was thus directed that
Shibusawa first saw Kinsan. She sat so high up
among the flowers as to be almost on a level with his
place of sitting, and she was so close that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
have spoken to her had he dared or deigned to do so.
She did not observe his keen recognition nor was she
conscious of his presence until the carriers began
slowly to straighten up and make ready to go forward.
Then as if by intuition she turned and looked toward
him and as she did so his eyes fairly met hers. Shibusawa
did not look away, but became more intent as
her soft dark eyelashes drooped and a faint flush
crept into her cheek. A something which he had
never before experienced came upon him, and for the
moment he felt bewildered and unable to move or
speak, and when the float had gone and Kinsan was
lost in the distance he made an effort as if to follow;
then recovering himself he lapsed into serious thought.</p>

<p class="indent">He had little further interest in the parade and
gave no heed to it until the high-raised chair and
brilliant trappings of the shogun himself went past.
He was conscious only that a new life had dawned:
that something had taken hold of him which was new
to his being; something which seemed to wield a more
powerful influence over him than even the presence
of the shogun&#151;the one person other than his own
kith and kin whom he had been taught to revere as
supreme.</p>

<p class="indent">The stately train marched along, though Shibusawa
had dismissed all but the one event; the circumstance
that raised the most serious problem which as
yet had confronted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Is it possible after all that there is something
higher and better than kings and ancestors?&#148; thought
he, as he grappled with the struggle which had already
seized him. &#147;And yet the instrument of that something
but a woman? What thing is this that seems
so contrary to all our philosophy, so different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
our religion, yet keenly gnawing at my very inner
self? I needs must find out and if possible confront
the author; the one who has so impressed me, even
though she be but a woman and I a transgressor.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">So saying he called Okyo and proposed that they,
too, follow the line of march to the river&#146;s bank, or so
far as they might be permitted to go.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time great crowds of sight-seers had fallen
in behind the procession, and Shibusawa was compelled
to take his place with the rest and plod along
as best he could. The route traversed was along an
old roadway, which wound its course through a
thickly inhabited part of the city, coming directly
to the ancient bridge Ryozoku. As they wended
their way past endless rows of deserted houses or
closed shops, amidst streamers and bunting, Shibusawa
became deeply impressed with the boundless
patriotism and intense loyalty of the people. Everywhere
they were doing homage and nowhere was
heard the voice of discontent. He felt more than
ever proud of his country, and realised as never before
the importance of each individual&#146;s place.</p>

<p class="indent">They reached the river, Sumida, long after the
last of the courtiers had passed, and the long bridge
was then so thronged as to be impossible of further
access. Hence they abandoned that, the choicest
vantage point, and remained on the bank of the
river, from which they got only an indistinct view of
the shogun and his suite as they sailed down the
river in their gaily-decked house-boats, and passed
under the bridge, the crowning feat of the day. Had
they been closer Shibusawa might have recognised,
in a boat close after the shogun&#146;s, familiar faces&#151;the
same that escaped him earlier in the day, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
he sat dreaming of Kinsan and the accidental
meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that the most exciting feature of the day had
passed, Shibusawa&#146;s thoughts reverted to the incident
which had so deeply impressed him. Try as
best he might he could not dismiss it, and after a
while he became anxious, and wondered if it were
possible to see her again; and if he should, would she
recognise him? Then he said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why should she recognise me? And, what is
more, why should I seek to see her?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">However, he did try to see her, and when it became
certain that there was no chance of doing so at the
river he grew impatient, though more determined.
The daylight fireworks floating high in the air; the
music, the songs, and the laughter wafted from the
river; the dancing, the feasting, and the merry-making
on shore, ceased to be of interest, and by the time
they had finished a light luncheon at a convenient
tea house Shibusawa became anxious to return to
their own lodgings.</p>

<p class="indent">He had made up his mind that the most likely
place to meet the young maiden a second time was
at the very one where he first met her. There she
should pass while returning from the f&#234;te, though
under what circumstances he did not know. And
would she look again, or had she not remembered
him? These and many more were the questions
which Shibusawa asked himself during the interval
of returning and waiting; and as time passed he grew
uneasy. Something burned within him, and he felt
that he must see and know this beautiful woman.
He sat quietly in his rooms thinking only of her
coming. Presently a hurrying and gathering upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
the street signified the returning of the royal party;
whereupon Shibusawa sprang up and seated himself
at the balcony&#146;s edge, so that none could pass without
his seeing him.</p>

<p class="indent">A number of detachments had passed in order,
and then Kinsan came as before, except that she
was accompanied by several girl friends whom she
had been permitted to invite with her on the return
trip. They were laughing and chatting about things
which pleased them most, and Kinsan&#146;s added charms
appealed more than ever to Shibusawa. He leaned
over the balcony, as if drawn toward her by an unseen
hand, and prayed that in some way her attention
might be drawn to him and that he might once more
look into her eyes, if only for an instant.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan was so engaged with her companions that
she seemed about to go by without even a chance
look, and as she came closer his heart appeared almost
to stand still; though he was soon to be transported,
for when directly opposite, Kinsan gave him the long
looked for opportunity. Nor was there any mistaking
her intention for mere accident. Shibusawa read
that she too had experienced some sort of feeling
which this time prompted her to look, and to manifest
an interest, if not desire. It was more than he
could bear to let her go in silence; she would not stop
again, and he had not a moment to lose; he felt
that he must speak to her&#151;his very life depended
upon it&#151;he knew not why, nor did he care. He
must do what his heart told him to do.</p>

<p class="indent">Now had he realised his present position Shibusawa
might not have done what he was about to do, but
with his whole heart set upon one thing he for the
moment forgot himself, and ran down the straight-set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
stairs and out at the front, wholly under the force
of blind impulse. Under ordinary circumstances
there would have been no breach in doing what he
sought to do, for custom gave a gentleman the right
to approach an inferior without the least formality.</p>

<p class="indent">When he reached the street he found it difficult
to pass, and in consequence ran close to the moving
column and toward Kinsan. Coming almost within
reach of her he ran against an officer&#151;who followed
next after her&#151;and before he could fully recover
his balance the angered samurai whipped out his long
sword and struck him a blow that felled him; and not
being satisfied with this punishment he made a thrust
at the prostrate man and ran him through to the
ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately Okyo had followed close after, and
upon reaching his helpless master he threw himself
in front and personally suffered the tramping and
jeering of the curious crowds&#151;he was too grieved
and thoughtless to offer any other relief, and lay
there face downward, pulling at the soiled clothing
and crying, &#147;Shibusawa! Shibusawa!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">They had not remained in that situation long,
however, till the lord daimyo of Kanazawa himself
marched up&#151;his carriers stumbling in an effort
to pass the stricken Shibusawa and his faithful watch&#151;when
Okyo cried out as before the name of his
master. Maido, only too accustomed to hearing this
same distressing cry, would have gone by without
heed had he not unmistakably distinguished the name
of his son. He listened and heard it again, distinctly
recognising Oyko&#146;s voice. Without waiting
to call a halt he swung open the door, and to the
amazement of all leaped to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
Divining the full situation the lord daimyo quickly
threw himself at the side of his almost lifeless boy,
and raising him in his arms called for water. After
reviving him, and making a hasty examination of
the wound, Maido ordered attendants to place Shibusawa
in the chair and hasten with him to his own
home.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br/>
COURSE DETERMINED</h2>

<p class="indent">Kinsan had fortunately turned toward her companions
and did not see any of the cruelty of the
officer who so hastily invoked his authority. Her
sudden exchange of glances with Shibusawa was
unobserved by the rest of the party, and as they
resumed their going Kinsan continued in her former
happy mood, betraying only now and then a slight
flush, or an indifferent far-away look. Though she
was deeply impressed she had not attached any particular
significance to the strange meeting, and had no
thought of its being even the second time other than
accidental.</p>

<p class="indent">The returning procession broke line as each division
passed the main palace door, the several detachments
proceeding to their separate destinations as
custom or convenience might require, and accordingly
the flower float was carried directly to the home of its
chosen goddess. The house occupied by Kinsan and
her parents was a little red-lacquered cottage which,
standing at the farther end of a small garden plot,
under an overhanging cliff, and at the side of a small
brook which trickled down through the moss-covered
rocks, was almost hidden from view by flowers,
tall bushes, and trailing vines. It was reached by
means of a long, narrow path, which branched off
from the main roadway just inside the last gate and
below the citadel, winding its way around the hillside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
through a bit of woodland, past rocky gorges, and
over a high, lacquered bridge, terminating at the
bamboo gate which stood in front. Here Fujimoto,
her father, had been permitted to live with his family
and work in the gardens all his life-time as had his
father and grandfathers for many generations before
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan had never before been favoured with any
special privileges, and except for her rare beauty and
sweet disposition she might not have been selected
to represent Asama, goddess of flowers. Though
from birth her playground had been under the shadow
of the great shogun&#146;s palace she had never before
been permitted to approach him so closely, and if he
had ever even by accident spoken to her she did not
remember it. However, the proximity of her dwelling
and the occupation of her father had given her
entrance to all parts of the mysterious enclosure, and
in consequence she not only was familiar with the
buildings and grounds but knew something of the
habits and customs of all the household. Her bright
simplicity and pleasing manners had so impressed
others that she was well known to all of the servants
and to many of the attach&#233;s, and had become a
favourite among them.</p>

<p class="indent">Of these there was one who more than any other
took a fancy to Kinsan, and had repeatedly expressed
other than a passing interest in her. He had watched
her closely for more than two years and already
several times approached her father, offering to buy
the little maiden, as he called her, at a liberal price,
to serve his convenience for the lawful period of three
years. All these proposals had been stoutly refused,
though in a measure favoured by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
mother&#151;thrifty woman&#151;who was not only captivated by
the position of the applicant but inclined to consider
three hundred yens of more service to the family than
a doubtful daughter, especially that there were three
others growing up.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the daughter had no right to be and
never was a party to any of these negotiations she had
heard enough to convince her that however repulsive
this fellow, Tetsutaisho, might be, there was a good
prospect of her being compelled sometime to sacrifice
her life to gratify his desires. She could see but one
hope, and that was in her father&#146;s love. Her mother,
poisoned as she was, had even gone so far as to entertain
the base proposal in the presence of Kinsan herself,
whose innate sense of propriety had each time
prompted her to run away, with a blush of indignation.
She knew that he had been instrumental in procuring
for her the honour of that day, and yet she could not
thank him, for she well realised that it was probably
by his own arrangement that he and his detachment
was placed in line next after her; not that she might
thus be honoured, but that he might gaze upon her
there in her helpless situation; for now that she had
grown older and knew his intentions she had come to
regard him with something of horror, and tried as
much as she could to avoid his presence.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether Tetsutaisho had observed the glance of
recognition which passed between Shibusawa and
Kinsan matters not, for his rank in the shogun&#146;s army
permitted him to strike down any one of the common
people who dared so much as to brush against his
garment. He was a broad, sunken-chested man,
nearly six feet tall, and though less than thirty years
of age wore the uniform of a taisho (minor general)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
and was in fact a favourite of the shogun&#146;s. There
were a few stiff, blue-black hairs on his face as an
excuse for a beard, and a pair of small bullet eyes
glanced furtively or hung sullenly from his coarse,
brutal countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">When Tetsutaisho struck Shibusawa he did so
intending to cut him down as an example of authority&#151;and
as a warning to others of his supposed
class&#151;and thinking he had killed him outright with
only a stroke and a thrust he squared about and
swaggered on with his chest distended and his head
thrown back.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a fortunate circumstance that Okyo was
near at hand when Shibusawa fell, for though the
thrust was not a vital one, it was dangerously near
the heart and occasioned considerable loss of blood
and much weakness. The blow had so stunned him
that he lay unconscious and not only in the way of
those marching, but subject to the cuffs and kicks
of his fellows, who were profuse in their cries of,
&#147;Shame be upon the etas![<a href="#index8">8</a><a name="fn8" id="fn8"></a>] He insulted his honourable
superior!&#148; However, Okyo&#146;s faithfulness and the
father&#146;s coming saved him, while proper treatment
and a vigorous constitution soon effected his complete
recovery.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was it any the less luck that Maido was there,
for only his intense patriotism caused the lord daimyo,
in the uncertain absence of his son, to quit his comfortable
Kanazawa place and repair thus early to
the Tokyo castle. It was an unusual thing for him
to take up his residence at the capital city before
late in the autumn, though in point of elegance and
diversion of thought the latter home far surpassed
the former.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
This, the largest and oldest of the several daimyos&#146;
castles at Tokyo, stood inside the second and just
outside the inner moat which surrounded the palace.
The grounds were spacious, and lay to the left of the
main driveway, going toward the palace, close up
against the inner moat. Indeed, it was the choice
of a gentle slope which fringed the hill, rising on the
opposite side of the moat, within the sacred enclosure
above. A high stone battlement, battered and overgrown,
stood sentinel at the water&#146;s edge, and all
around giant cypress and strange foliage told of
another day. Here, in this place, was builded the
official seat of one man, a daimyo, now Maido, who
was the most favoured and courted at a shogun&#146;s
court, and who commanded the wealth, the intellect,
and the aspiration of a thousand years of unbroken,
unknown, and unsatisfied progress. Its
environment spoke for the present; its tombs, of the
past.</p>

<p class="indent">To this place, with such circumstances, Shibusawa
was carried, and for the first time in his life entered
there; a coming hoped and looked for, an ambition
cherished and nursed by his father until it had become
his constant dream; and yet that coming was to be
when the spark of life seemed all but dead. Maido
hastened to the family shrine and there prayed the
good god Dajiza to grant him power to ward off
death&#146;s evil hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa&#146;s rooms were at the upper side of the
main court building (a rambling red-lacquered structure,
with curled tile roof) overlooking the greensward
and battlement, toward where Kinsan&#146;s cottage
nestled in the nearby woodland. Here he lay for a
long time, battling against death, till science and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
care had overcome danger, then his vigorous constitution
rapidly brought on a complete and permanent
recovery. While convalescing he would often sit
chatting with his father, or dreaming of things now
fast crowding upon him: the poverty and the toil;
the suffering and the patriotism; the dormant power
and the helplessness of the people which he had
everywhere seen; his own new-born love; the ruthless
force of an officer&#151;all these were weighing heavily
upon his young conscience, which already flamed with
ambition.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa did not dwell upon these things, though,
while conversing with his father; and he asked no
questions. But never before did he understand so
well the whole philosophy of his parent&#146;s teachings,
nor grasp so firmly the force of his logic and the
meaning of all their institutions. And there, and
alone, while the vigour of youth yet fired the contact
of life, after the bloom of knowledge, the polish of
intercourse, the inspiration of travel, he determined
his course.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br/>
THE HIDDEN CAVE</h2>

<p class="indent">Time began, after a while, to drag heavily and
Shibusawa thirsted for a change. The day
Chayo, moon festival (in the latter part of September),
had already come, and while sitting in the evening
with his favourite sister, Nehachibana, he half spoke,
half meditated:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you think I could go out to see the moon rise
to-night? You know it is Chayo, and I want to
wander off by myself and see the &#145;grand three.&#146; It
will enable me to start under a good omen. Pray
come, don&#146;t say &#145;No,&#146; for I fear I shall have to go
anyway.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana had been his almost constant companion
since the night of his misfortune, and she felt
nervous about his taking any undue risk now that
he was recovering so nicely. She was tall and seriously
earnest, and her counsel was invariably welcomed
by her energetic brother, though not always
acted upon. Therefore she spoke with uncertain
confidence when she answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It certainly is a shame to stay indoors at such
a time and upon such a night as the day promises.
You are now somewhat accustomed to the open air,
and if you do not remain too long I can see no danger.
I myself am going out upon the green there, below
the house, and I should be glad to have you for company.
Come join me, will you not?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&#147;No, thank you; I want to be alone, for once. I
shall go inside the gate to find a good lookout there,
on the hillside. It is a splendid chance&#151;and there
will not be so many sight-seers there. Few of those
on the inside engage in so light a diversion, and from
the outside&#151;well, only those who can enter can
stroll.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, Shibusawa, how can you think of venturing
in there! You know it is absolutely forbidden, and
the guards may beat you down, should you try,&#148;
said she, her voice trembling with fright.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Have no fear, Nehachibana; I am already on
more than friendly terms with those fellows, and I
assure you when once inside there is no danger of
discovery. I want to go there, where I can see and
think without molestation, and you know nothing less
can rid me of my good fellow Okyo. And then, the
adventure. That will be stimulating, and I shall
tell you all about it to-morrow. There, now, let us
not discuss it further. Good-night.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening Shibusawa, as planned, passed
through the gate and entered the august enclosure,
where lived the only earthly being whom he had been
taught to revere above his own ancestry. True, the
mikado[<a href="#index9">9</a><a name="fn9" id="fn9"></a>] had received no less a consideration, but
his was of a divine character. The one, the mikado,
spiritual; the other, the shogun, material: both, rulers
supreme and eternal.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon entering the sacred place a mist of uncertainty
seemed to envelop him and, though there
was no particular wrong in his doing so even in such
a manner, he felt as if he were unprepared, and that
his presence might profane the place. Contrary to
any precedent, while entering he chatted freely with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
the guards on duty and did not hesitate to disclose
his identity; nor did he in any manner attempt to
deceive. His motives were pure and his means convincing;
the guards had occasion to trust him, hence
they passed him. No mention had been made of
his noticeably injured condition, for the very good
reason that no questions had been asked; and, beside
his father, to whom Shibusawa had made a full explanation,
the cause and manner of his wounding
remained unknown to all, excepting himself, and
possibly the man who did the striking. Before starting
he had changed his customary dress for that of
an ordinary attendant, so that had he been discovered
in the grounds anywhere not forbidden he might
have been taken for a regular attach&#233;; especially
inasmuch as he was again well tanned and somewhat
rugged.</p>

<p class="indent">Keeping to the left as was the custom, Shibusawa
strolled along the main roadway until he came to a
path which chanced to be the one leading toward the
gardener&#146;s cottage. As he walked along in that
silent mysterious dusk he had passed unnoticed several
who were each on his way to the city outside
either to keep an engagement or seek diversion from
the monotony of court life. Now and then the
rattling of a sword-hilt or the clanking of steel warned
him of the rank and occupation of the passerby. A
slight faintness came over him as the first sound of
one had grated upon his ears, and then his understanding
changed and he felt something of pity for
the man whose only means of a livelihood seemed to
be the striking of his fellow-men.</p>

<p class="indent">Taking the cottage roadway he gladly, and with
more leisure, plodded along the hillside until he came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
to a bypath which led off to his right and seemingly
rose over a cliff farther on. The desire for adventure
as well as a better chance of being let alone prompted
him to follow this path, and as he trod upon the soft,
beaten mould his sandals made no sound save now
and then an accidental rasping or the occasional
rattling of a fallen leaf. Nothing but quickened
thoughts disturbed him here, until presently he came
to a rustic bridge which crossed a dancing brooklet
that faintly moaned and cried on its way. Half
doubtful he stepped upon the beaten plank, and the
sound aroused from her reverie a young maiden who
stood midway on the bridge, and whom he had not
until then observed. She turned as he proceeded,
and then he recognised her and cried out:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My honourable maiden.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan, too, had stolen away and gone there that
she, also, might have the good luck to see the moon
rise in her majestic form of three. She had been
standing she knew not how long in the centre of the
bridge, with her elbows resting on the side rail and
her dimpled cheeks buried in her hands, watching and
dreaming as only one of her age can, and already
there was beginning to shadow from above that
mysterious, awe inspiring grey blue which hovers
between the last of twilight and the coming of moonrise.
Perhaps she also was thinking of one who had
risen in her life, yet of whom she could not hope to
know. Thus startled she did not recognise Shibusawa,
nor did she attempt to move, but stood there
undecided, while he, blushing perceptibly, said in a
reassuring tone:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I pray your forgiveness, madam, for so disturbing
you. My name is Shibusawa, and I beg of you the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
pleasure of knowing who you are and what brings
you here to this lovely spot at this delightful hour?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing that she hesitated as if debating what to do
he continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I pray you to believe me worthy, and to trust my
motive, my honourable madam.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Though Kinsan did not yet recognise her strange
visitor she was not alarmed; there was something
about him that invited her confidence, and before she
realised it she had raised her eyes to his and there
in the glimmer of the starlight had experienced the
same feeling which had held her bounden since
the time of their first meeting. The suddenness of
the recognition and the fulness of her soul caused her
to blush, and to stand meekly with drooping eyes
and head bowed. Then she said modestly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am Kinsan, the gardener&#146;s daughter. I came
here to see the beautiful moon rise, should it be so
kind and I so fortunate. I do not know who you
are, but I trust and I believe you will permit me to
pass without harm. I have parents who love me,
and I know you are of our faith. I trust you, honourable
sir, to speak further if you so desire.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I thank you,&#148; said he, &#147;for your frank expressions,
and I swear by the sword, Amanosakohoko, that I
shall endeavour to merit your confidence. May I not
spread this robe so that we can sit, and further speak
to each other while waiting the moon&#146;s pleasure?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You may do so if you like, but I should tell you
that it is unsafe unless you have permission from
a better authority. There is one who sometimes
passes here, and should he discover you I fear his
cruelty might be no less severe than my interest
is great. If you do not mind a short, steep climb I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
will lead the way to a secluded spot near by where we
can get a still better view and also guard against being
seen. I was just going there, and no one will miss me
at home until the hour has gone. Shall I proceed?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I certainly shall be glad to trust myself to your
guidance, and if it is not too hard for you to go there
it ought not to be for me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You see,&#148; said Kinsan, as she led the way back
across the bridge and began climbing the hill above,
&#147;there is no pathway to follow. That is because no
one but myself ever goes there, and I take pains not
to establish a road and thus provide the means to
a discovery of my hidden place.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">After leaving the by-path they scrambled up with
some difficulty over the embankment and through
a brier patch into the woodland beyond. Hereafter
their passage through the scattering trees was quite
easy, except the long grass and sloping hill made it
necessary for them to choose well their steps, and
as they went they chatted with no concern or accident
to mar their pleasures or stay the confidence
that was so rapidly growing between them. The
balmy air, the inviting scenery, the romantic occasion,
all inspired those feelings of trust which come
of more than understanding and which are never
abused.</p>

<p class="indent">Once Kinsan slipped a little and threw out her
arms to recover her balance. As if by instinct Shibusawa
was at her side and caught her hand in his just
in time to save a fall; the soft skin told him of her
good breeding, and the warm blood of her perfect
health. He held it gently, a little longer, perhaps,
than necessary to stay her fall, and then he did not
drop it nor did she take it away, but as if moved by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
an unseen power and with feelings sweeter than life
itself started on, and Kinsan did not fall or lose her
balance again that night.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, what a grand place it is!&#148; said he, as she led
him to a seat on one side looking out over a panorama
of woodland and battlement and castle ground and
city far away toward the rising moon.</p>

<p class="indent">The place to which Kinsan led captive was an old
abandoned nook, which had centuries before been
used as a sight-seeing retreat by no less a personage
than the shogun himself. It lay far up on the hillside
in a small level space that rounded out at the
head of a miniature gulch, through which ran the
rivulet spanned by the bridge where the lovers met.
The site, now dry and hard, was once the source of a
natural spring, which had long ago disappeared
through a tunnel made farther down the declivity.
It was an ideal place for a hidden cave, such as it
really appeared to be and as Kinsan called it; and
the shogun under whose direction it was improved had
spared no expense to make it a place of beauty as
well as seclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">A retaining wall at the back,&#151;in which were constructed
wide and comfortable stone seats,&#151;rounded
up at both corners and arched over in front, while
trees and vines had been so planted here and there
as to shade the sun or break the storm, without in any
manner obstructing the view. Some of these giant
trees still stood, marking the grandeur of a different
age. Others had fallen and long ago disappeared,
while vines and shrubs had grown and regrown into
tangled gnarls of brush and brier. All trace of its
once gravelled approach and smooth floor had
vanished with age, and no other person now found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
his way there except by merest chance or a curious
reverence.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan was the cave&#146;s only regular visitor and,
jealously, she took every precaution to avoid attracting
any attention to it. Unlike her sisters and her
girl friends she wanted some place to which she could
go and be by herself, and there indulge in that freedom
which made her so different from others as well as
the envy of all who knew her. She had with her own
hands cleared the place of briers and fallen debris,
and had carried straw and mats there to cover and
make more comfortable a seat. Why, she did not
know, but she loved different things from those
which pleased the people whom she knew, and at
times she longed to breathe a different atmosphere
and to think new thoughts and experience other
feelings. And now that this queer little house of
hers contained another&#151;one in whom all her sentiments
seemed to enliven and to crystallise&#151;her
heart filled and there rose within her a new being,
whose love and innocence and purity and sweetness
shone forth like a flood-light of truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa, too, felt the irresistible oncoming of
that new life which had taken hold of him the first
time he saw Kinsan; nor did he try to dissuade it,
for in it he saw and felt the force of nature, the power
of Infinity.</p>

<p class="indent">They sat there and talked and thought of things
that were sweet and dear to them. Only once were
they disturbed, and that was shortly after they had
gone there and while they were sitting and dreaming
as only true lovers can. It was just when the light
and dark seemed most uncertain and everything
mysteriously told of a parting and welcomed an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
oncoming. A cloud lazily floated overhead, turning
its golden fringe into a border of silver. Not a leaf
rustled or a note sounded on the hollow air. Not
even they seemed conscious of another living thing,
when out of the stillness there came the unmistakable
sound of a man walking rapidly in a silk kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Swish, swish, swish,&#148; continued grating upon
Shibusawa&#146;s ear, each time more distinct, and he
half rose to his feet as if ready to bound upon an
enemy. Kinsan caught hold of his kimono and
whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do not be disturbed. I have heard it before,
and I can tell from the sound just who it is and about
where he is walking: he is now on the by-path not
far from the bridge where we last met. If he turns
this way I shall warn you in time so that we can hide
in a secret place I have found out just above this.
It is easy of access, and he never could find us there.
It is grown over with an old wisteria and is out of
reach of that one, I am sure.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The man in the by-path continued to walk briskly
along, keeping a close watch on either side. He
seemed to be quite nervous and anxious, though he
moved with determination and evinced a fixed purpose.
His course led him around the gulch so far
below, and they were so hidden behind the trees, that
they were seldom exposed to his view, yet they themselves
could see and distinguish even the features
of any person well impressed upon the memory. The
intruder did not pause until he had reached the footbridge,
where only a short time before Shibusawa
and Kinsan had met, and then he stopped and looked
as if expecting to see someone. Once he stared
momentarily straight toward the cave, and had he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
been aware of such a place he might have distinguished
the two sitting there only partially shielded
by the bushes. Shibusawa as it was had the advantage,
and looked the stranger directly in the face. He
trembled, then leaned forward and stared intently.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Pray do not be alarmed,&#148; said Kinsan, in a low
voice, already divining his keen interest. &#147;Even
though he see us and should come this way we are
yet safe. My hiding-place will not fail me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;If I mistake not,&#148; answered Shibusawa, &#147;we shall
have no need for hiding&#151;I have at least a more
satisfactory thought.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, no, honourable sir, we must not be seen by
him!&#148; said Kinsan, nervously. &#147;He is such a terrible
man; and very powerful and brave, they say.
If he should discover me here, and at this hour, and
in the company of a man&#151;oh, how late it is getting!
I think I must be going.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you know him, do you?&#148; asked Shibusawa,
quickly and interestedly, though speaking in an
undertone.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, yes; I know him well,&#148; said she, without any
hesitancy.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And he is seeking you here? and now? I shall
meet him forthwith.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, he often does, and I am so glad&#151;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Aha, and I am so nicely trapped!&#148; said he, meditatively.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer him, for the reason that she
did not understand him, and without so doing there
was no occasion for an answer. He said nothing,
but sat for the moment alternating between rage and
jealousy. He looked at the burly form on the bridge,
then at Kinsan. He thought of his love, then of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
wounding. He at first determined to accuse her and
fly at his antagonist, but afterwards reasoned that
there was nothing to be gained by haste, and also
that possibly he might be misinformed, if not entirely
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">Their visitor soon turned around, his back toward
them, and as if disappointed at the prospect hung
himself upon the bridge rail and stared vacantly at
the distant horizon. Presently he straightened up
and slowly walked away; and not until he had entirely
gone did either Shibusawa or Kinsan speak;
nor would they yet have resumed talking had Shibusawa
been the first to begin. He still pondered a
doubt about the real circumstance, though his faith
in Kinsan strengthened as he himself recovered.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am so glad he has gone away. Oh, if he would
only not come back! Did he frighten you much?&#148;
said she, her voice betraying her anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I cannot say that I was so much as frightened,
though I feel better now that he has gone,&#148; said he,
evasively. &#147;Why, Kinsan, you do look pleased, and
I really believe you, too, are glad to be rid of him.
It is unfortunate that he came just at this time&#151;I
wonder if my being here influenced his coming? Still,
I hardly believe it could have done so, because I do
not even know his name, much less does he know me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, no. That was Tetsutaisho, an officer in
the shogun&#146;s army,&#148; said Kinsan, assuringly and
without divining Shibusawa&#146;s purpose, &#147;and I am
certain it was not because you were here that he
came. And I am so glad that you are here! I am
lonely when I sit here by myself, and now&#151;you will
come again, will you not?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa did not answer her at once, but turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
and looked, and her soft true eyes looked into his,
and he saw how cruel he had been to let suspicion
enter his heart and how unworthy of her confidence
he had been. Then all his manhood rose and his
thoughts became pure and his feelings true, and his
courage spoke as he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The moon had risen, and&#151;how could they have
seen it other than as it was, a good omen? for they
two and it made three.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br/>
THE PLEDGE</h2>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa and Kinsan sat in their place and
gazed at the beautiful moon as it rose, now unfolding
a deeper meaning, teaching a sweeter lesson.
Chayo was no longer to them only a mystic rite, but
a living, eternal symbol of life&#146;s greatest joy, and
when they had seen all and felt its power they arose
and parted, true to themselves and pleased with
their good fortune. Shibusawa, though, returned to
his house fully aware of the responsibilities which he
had assumed and deeply impressed with their probable
consequences; yet he realised that the circumstances
which had brought about this irresistible
situation were conceived directly within his own
heart, and that he could not and should not escape
their natural and just conclusion. He loved Kinsan,
and, whether right or wrong in that love, he must
know a higher virtue before he could in justice to
himself surrender what seemed to him purely a
liberty of conscience.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor would his love be unrequited, for he saw in
Kinsan the same unknown force which had moved
him and held him its willing victim. She too was a
slave to its inevitable decree, and now that they had
witnessed in each other that repose of confidence
necessary to a perfect understanding, he must not let
love, a higher purpose, fail at the bidding of family or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
state, nor allow himself to halt in his proper pursuit
at the voice of tradition or, said he:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Even by the law&#146;s decree; for after all, &#145;Is law
higher than our understanding?&#146;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Having decided not to swerve from his course
Shibusawa began to plan the means whereby he could
meet Kinsan and be with her as much as prudence
would allow. He longed to be near her and to share
with her his thoughts and gain her approval, but in
doing so he must encounter many hardships and
much danger. Both statute and custom bade him
marry the woman selected only by his parents, and
to woo any other and in such a manner was deemed a
most serious breach, subject to a severe penalty. He
needs must, therefore, employ strategy, for there was
no other means of meeting Kinsan, and even that
could never make her his wife. The laws of his
country were rigid, and his parents, like others, inexorable
on that subject; and Shibusawa was not unmindful
of either, nor of his duty toward society; yet
he was undaunted, and could see no wrong in his
loving the woman of his choice, so long as that one
brought neither disgrace to his family nor failure to
himself; neither of which was probable from his way
of thinking&#151;and had he a right to think? That
was one of the questions which had determined
Shibusawa&#146;s course, and it now became a burning
factor in his life.</p>

<p class="indent">The hidden cave was their rendezvous, and Kinsan
grew to live for the happiness its welcome shelter
gave. There, the sweet voice of love whispered and
rewhispered the new song that soothed and quickened
and held her captive, for Shibusawa came faithfully
and constantly, each recurring visit deepening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
his love, every serious obstacle strengthening his
determination.</p>

<p class="indent">Time passed quickly and each returning season lent
anew its never dying symbol, for to them autumn&#146;s
master flower, the chrysanthemum, meant in truth
loyalty, sincerity, and earnestness. When these days
had passed and winter come Shibusawa sang to her
the song of the pine and its fidelity, the bamboo and
its elasticity, the plum and its courage, vigour, and
reputation. Then spring brought in its train the
cherry, the peach, the pear, the primrose, the peony,
the wisteria, each in turn adding its voice, for the
cave stood in the midst of bloom, everywhere doing
its part in the beautiful fulfilment of a divine promise.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, spring had come and with it the budding and
the joy of creation. It was now April, the day of the
cherry blossom, and the sun had gone down behind
the hills and the stars were twinkling their story.
Two lovers sat close together&#151;the one ambitious,
courageous; the other obedient, loyal&#151;both joyous,
but earnest. Her hand rested in his and he bent
over and whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Kinsan, I love you. I love you with a heart that
is pure and true. I love you with all my life, my
soul voices it. I think of you always&#151;the one
constant thought of my life&#151;my hope, my happiness,
my existence. Speak, Kinsan, speak and tell me that
this is not a hopeless fancy. Tell me that you love
me. Tell me that you will be my wife, my love, my
sweetheart, my all.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She leaned forward and laid her rosy cheek upon
his bosom, and with her eyes softly upturned she
whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
He stooped down and kissed her, and in the warmth
of those lips she saw a world of joys; he, the beginning
of earnest life. The kiss was unknown to them, but
it came as the spontaneous outpouring of a true affection,
the token of a master passion; and in that
embrace there dawned a new light, the opening of
another world.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br/>
AN UNEXPECTED COMMAND</h2>

<p class="indent">While Shibusawa had been constant and true in
his attentions he had never apprised Kinsan of
his real position, nor of the difficulties which stood in
the way of their marriage. That he was worthy
there could be no doubt in her mind, and she only
knew that she loved him&#151;loved him as they were
and with no thought of what might or would befall
them. Instinct was enough to keep both from
mentioning their affairs to any others, for such a
thing as mutual regard was by right or practice
unknown in the land; hence must have been deemed
improper, especially by the parents, and there were
no others to whom they could or should confide their
secrets. Whether allowable or not, and without any
real knowledge of the consequences, their love had
grown and manifested itself in its own mysterious
way, and they were destined as they were to meet an
uncertain fate.</p>

<p class="indent">Very wisely Shibusawa had not in the meantime
neglected any of his proper relations at home, but on
the contrary entered into life with an earnestness that
was not only to his father, but to others of the family
and to his friends, a great source of joy. Whether at
the Koyo-odori (maple dance for girls), or at the
New Year&#146;s feast, or at any of the many f&#234;tes of the
season, his interest was equally keen and his presence
always sought. Nor did he neglect his personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
improvement, for all of his time and energy not
devoted to Kinsan and his social duties were expended
in an orderly quest for knowledge; not of a theoretical
nature, but of that practical, satisfying kind
that, whether for good or for ill, moves the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Maido had observed with keen interest all these
healthy activities of his son and was proud of his
achievements and offered him every encouragement
within his power. No particular attention had been
paid to Shibusawa&#146;s future other than properly to fit
him for the place destined for him, and such a thing
as the young prince&#146;s marriage had never seriously
entered his father&#146;s mind. Since the birth of his rising
successor Maido had always hoped to avoid the necessity
of sometime being compelled to sacrifice his son&#146;s
or his own happiness to gratify the pleasure or convenience
of the court, though he might at any time have
been prompted to do as much by an extreme test of
loyalty. As far as the lord daimyo&#146;s own interests
were concerned there had as yet appeared no need for
matrimonial alliances of any kind, and not until
political discontent began to arise in the south had
he been called upon to concern himself particularly
about outside affairs. He had personally held aloof
from all entangling alliances, and aside from his
duties at court devoted himself to the upbuilding
and preservation of his own prefecture, which was
now so strong and prosperous that it could reasonably
be expected to stand of its own accord.</p>

<p class="indent">There was the best of feeling and good content
everywhere at home, and when there Maido himself
might at any time be seen among his workmen encouraging
thrift and economy, while all of the new ideas
were regularly taught by learned instructors. As a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
result his people had become the most skilled and
industrious in the land, excelling in the production of
rice, silk, lacquer rugs, matting, bronzes, pottery,
steel, and implements of husbandry and articles for
ornamentation.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore Maido was one of the most powerful as
he was resourceful of the shogun&#146;s daimyos and had
wisely looked askance at the petty quarrels and fierce
rebellions that were constantly devastating other
parts of the country and robbing them of their treasure.
Still he did not neglect to cultivate a true
martial spirit, nor to maintain an army in keeping
with the country&#146;s dignity; which, owing to the
mountainous approaches at the east and south, and
to the broad open sea and rocky shores of the west
and north, was as against an invading foe easily
defended. These natural barriers having been seized
upon early after the beginning of the shogunate and
from time to time fortified, Maido had but to keep
them in repair and refrain from interfering with
outside affairs in order to induce the powerful armies
of the north and south, while marching against each
other, to pass him by unmolested. In consequence
his vassals&#151;secure in their peace, in plenty, sure of
kind and liberal treatment, their religion inviolate
and their customs well established&#151;were quite
content to labour faithfully for the promotion of
their daimyo&#146;s comfort and power. He was at the
same time the most respected and envied personage
at court, and even the shogun himself found it
both agreeable and advantageous to cultivate his
friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">This pleasing situation, however, was not long to
continue, for the outgrowth of Maido&#146;s wisdom, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
his abundance at home, made him the more coveted
at Tokyo; and now that hostilities were assuming
proportion in the south, the necessity for new expedients
was fast crowding upon the northern party.
To Iyeyoshi, the over-fed, easy-going shogun, these
matters were rather irksome and in consequence
were being more and more turned over to the newly
appointed prime minister, the young and restless
Ikamon. The shogun was satisfied; Ikamon,
ambitious.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter had risen from the lower ranks by dint
of his own exertions, and his career was as unbounded
as it was unbridled. In presence he was pinched
and bony, stoop shouldered, of peaked face, had eagle
eyes, rather sparse, stiff black hair, and for strength
of mind displayed a wonderful mixture of cunning
and craft. He had already formed a personal alliance
with Maido (which materially strengthened him at
court and directly helped him into his present position)
by taking in marriage Yasuko, the daimyo&#146;s
second daughter; and now ostensibly as a state measure,
but in reality to further Ikamon&#146;s personal
schemes, Shibusawa was urgently brought forward
as a likely match for Takara, a rising member of the
royalty, and a daughter of the mikado himself.</p>

<p class="indent">When the proposal was first made, Maido paid but
little heed to it, passing it by as one of his son-in-law&#146;s
many visionary schemes; in the majority of which
he had not much confidence and as yet less concern.
He had intended to govern himself in this matter,
when the proper time came, as he had in all others,
as best conserved his own interests and the happiness
of his son. That any one dared to interfere with
what he considered his and his family&#146;s private affair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
had not seriously dawned upon his mind, and was
this time looked upon as a piece of ill-advised
impertinence.</p>

<p class="indent">In time, however, the over-confident daimyo discovered
his mistake, for Ikamon persisted and before
long had enlisted the support of a higher influence,
one that presently assumed the shape of an urgent
request, if not command. Such an alliance, once
proposed, was not in times of stress to be overlooked
even by the shogun, and Maido soon found himself
entangled with a problem that was to bring his son
face to face with the queenly and much coveted
Takara.</p>

<p class="indent">Though only the daughter by a favourite concubine,
this beautiful princess was much loved by Komei,
the mikado, and it was conceded that whoever gained
her hand would not only gain his royal highness&#146;
favour, but strengthen his position at the Kyoto
court. She was tall and slender, not yet twenty
years of age, had bright, tender eyes, a soft, clear skin,
and silken hair as dark as the raven. Her manner
was that of grace and distinction, her speech calm
and deliberate, while at court and among her friends
she was regarded with almost reverence. Daikomitsu,
a rising young prince and staunch supporter of the
southern party, had already sought her hand in marriage,
and withal, aside from any political considerations,
she might have been thought eminently fitted
to become the wife even of a Maido&#146;s successor.</p>

<p class="indent">It was with different considerations, though, that
Ikamon urged the suit. He knew of no demand
except that of policy, and now that he was in a position
effectively to reach both sides he hastened the
business as much as he consistently could. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
mikado was, notwithstanding the advice of his counsellors,
still in favour of peace, and thus he lent a
ready ear to any proposal that might be reasonably
expected to calm the disturbance and ward off a final
conflict. His daughter, having grown to womanhood
within the palace and its traditional and superstitious
atmosphere, knew nothing of the profane world and
was possessed of a loyalty that carried her far over
into the sweep of ancestral worship. She believed
that her only province was to serve, and that of right
she should be handed from father to husband, from
the one family to the other. Her birth seemed but
a necessity, her life a sacrifice, and her death only
a natural consequence&#151;why should she look or
think or hope beyond? She offered no protest when
told of her lot&#151;that she must yield her all unto a
stranger&#151;but bowed in grateful submission at the
command of an unquestioned fate. She promised
her father, and he was pleased, and hastened to inform
the shogun.</p>

<p class="indent">Maido as yet had said nothing to Shibusawa about
his prospective marriage, though he himself had been
fully convinced that there was no possible way for
him to avoid its final consummation without as a last
resort breaking faith with the shogun: a thing entirely
beyond the pale of his moral rectitude. He
had from time to time avoided the subject, trusting
that some failure at Kyoto might save him the necessity,
but now that the mikado had favourably responded
and the shogun positively commanded, all
hope was dissipated.</p>

<p class="indent">He therefore called his son to him and led him into
the great chamber, where he bade him be seated at
his side. It was in the evening, and Maido had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
returned flushed and heated from an animated council,
and he chose the open side of the room, where they
sat facing each other and alone. A warm breeze
floated in from the garden, and the air seemed to
Shibusawa almost as sweet with cherry blossom as
it had the day before while sitting with Kinsan at the
hidden cave. He realised that some grave question
disturbed his parent, but little thought that he himself
was the victim of a prearranged plan that should
augur so uncertain a future. He would have spoken,
but his father beckoned him be silent; then himself
spoke distinctly, telling him of what he was expected
to do, and waited for an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no mistaking the meaning, yet Shibusawa
sat in silence; he was for the moment dazed
and unable to make any answer. After the first
flush he resolved upon throwing himself at his father&#146;s
feet and explaining all; to ask forgiveness for what
he had done, and beg indulgence for what his life
seemed pledged to do, but prudence bade him not.
He knew only too well that such a thing was impossible.
Maido&#146;s anxiety doubled with each succeeding
moment, until finally surprise, then fear, moved him
and his voice trembled as he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shibusawa, my son, have you no ears?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I hear you, father, and I assure you it is my
weakness and not the answer that makes me slow.
I would frame you a better speech than the one I
have in mind.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Hold, my boy! I know your answer. And,
besides, I would rather you save your words for a
higher purpose. This old self of mine is satisfied
that you do the thing. That is it. Oshaka! Oshaka!
good god of self, forbid that I hear, let me only feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
a father&#146;s blessing and a son&#146;s forgiveness. Come, my
good son, your liberal indulgence of me and your ready
acceptance of her has removed from me the greatest
concern of my life. A long one, and a happy one&#151;hah!
h-a-h! h&#151;a&#151;h!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Maido&#146;s eyes flashed dry and hot as he sat there
swinging his powerful frame back and forth to the
rhythm of his parched words. Shibusawa knelt
quickly at his father&#146;s side and steadied and soothed
him. The long white locks parted and fell from his
splendid brow, and in an instant the son&#146;s whole
soul went out to the one who had given him being
and had showered upon him a constant devotion.</p>

<p class="indent">The lord daimyo went to sleep presently, and
Shibusawa sat for a long time, debating the consequences
of this new and unexpected situation. It
was only yesterday that he had pledged himself to
the one he loved, and now he was bound by every
tradition and law to break that engagement and
perform a duty. Had this sudden mandate come
only a day sooner his honour, at least, might have
been saved; but to sacrifice that was more than he
could do. Filial affection&#151;but was there not a
higher purpose, and if so why not devote his life to
its fulfilment? He pondered, then said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Although I uphold the traditions of our religion,
maintain the honour of my family, and obey the
command of the shogun, I can and will be true to
Kinsan.&#148;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br/>
THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY</h2>

<p class="indent">When Shibusawa arose the next morning, he
set about with a heavy heart to plan some
course of action. He had not slept much during the
night, and with a clouded atmosphere the morning
was dull, so he remained in the garden but a short
time, returning to his now cold and dreary chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">At first he planned to hurry to Kinsan and tell her
the truth and beg her forgiveness; then he realised
the impossibility of doing so; the gates were closed to
him, and his strategy would not avail him in the daytime.
He rightly divined his father&#146;s helplessness,
and knew that an appeal to the court would fall upon
deaf ears. The law was inexorable, and those in
authority would use it, as they were using him, to
further their own schemes. To fly was worse than
hopeless, and to disclose the identity of his love would
surely bring death if not torture to her. Such were
some of the conditions confronting Shibusawa, and
with which he must struggle.</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon was fully advised of the rapidly rising
influence of the literary, or southern party, at the
mikado&#146;s, or royal court, and he hastened that no
time be lost in using this last measure to check its
growth. The banns were accordingly that day
published at Tokyo, and the marriage proclaimed to
take place at the earliest possible day in May, the
month following; while messengers were despatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
to Kyoto with the intelligence, so that Takara might
make ready and repair to her intended father-in-law&#146;s
seat at the shogun&#146;s capital city.</p>

<p class="indent">During the interval of waiting the busy prime
minister more than ever bestirred himself with making
preparations for the ceremony. Maido was pushed
to one side and his natural prerogatives usurped by
his son-in-law, Ikamon, who, without much regard
to rank, invited everybody whom he thought could
in any way further his own political chances and
incidentally those of his party. Thus Tetsutaisho
was included among the selected guests, for in him
more than any other Ikamon saw a future powerful
weapon.</p>

<p class="indent">This young officer was rapidly advancing in favour,
and Ikamon reasoned that his chances of being
placed at the head of the shogun&#146;s army, already
good, would be effectually strengthened by an alliance
with the powerful house of Maido. There was the
good and handsome Nehachibana, Maido&#146;s daughter
and Shibusawa&#146;s favourite&#151;why not offer her to Tetsutaisho?
With Tetsutaisho, his ready confidant, securely
in command of the northern army, his alliance
with the royal court established through Shibusawa&#146;s
marriage, he had designed a still more sweeping
stroke, that of tricking the mikadate into a tacit
coalition of the two armies, the north and the south,
with Tetsutaisho as the recognised head of both.
Ikamon believed that in such a situation he could
effectually put down any local disaffection, gradually
dissipate the mikadate, and eventually establish the
shogunate as the sole, supreme authority in the land.</p>

<p class="indent">His plan was a vital one, and there seemed to be no
real obstacle in the way of its final consummation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
Tetsutaisho had already looked upon Nehachibana
with a sordid eye; she was young and vivacious&#151;that
was enough for him. Shibusawa was now
perceptibly occupied with his own troubles, and
should readily fall a victim to the magic of a royal
court. Maido was rapidly approaching a certain
state of senility&#151;possibly apparent to none but
his covetous son-in-law&#151;and could no longer offer
any serious resistance. There was no further chance
for a misalliance in the family, no moral gulf between
the driver and the goal, so Ikamon devised and the
wedding day found him easily prepared.</p>

<p class="indent">When that day had arrived and the guests were assembled,
a dust-bedraggled train of carriers and attendants
came filing up the roadway to the front of Maido&#146;s
castle, where they halted and demanded entrance in
the name of Takara, daughter of Komei, the divine
mikado. Upon the conclusion of this short ceremony
the party was passed through the gate to the house
door, where the bride was delivered into the care of
Ikamon and Yasuko, his wife, who bade her welcome
after the fashion of another polite ceremony. Takara
wore a flowing kimono of soft white material, and
now that she had entered the house of her future
husband she forthwith retired and changed her dress
for one provided by the bridegroom. Having thus
completed her toilet she was escorted to the chamber
of state by Yasuko, while Ikamon attended
Shibusawa.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara meekly entered, and as she did so the
sound of many voices and much merry-making greeted
her; the guests were assembled in a room adjoining,
waiting for the conclusion of the ceremony and the
beginning of the feast. Shibusawa then came forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
betraying only a slight colour, and Takara
humbly bowed recognition; he bowed and motioned
her to a mat at his side. They had met, and for the
first time looked into the mirror of each other&#146;s life.
The two-lipped cup was offered by Haraku, the
bride&#146;s maid-servant, and Takara moistened her lips
therefrom, then passed it to the bridegroom, who in
turn drank a draught, and passed it back to her.
Thrice three times they did this, and the ceremony
was complete.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 468px;">

<img class="border" src="images/i_062fp.jpg" width="468" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">The two-lipped cup was offered.... Takara moistened her lips
therefrom, then passed it to the bridegroom.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Without any further ado the bride again retired
and changed her light kimono for a coloured one of
her own providing. In her absence the sliding partitions
had been removed, and when she returned she
found herself in the midst of the merry guests, who
crowded about to offer their congratulations.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa appeared to be deeply impressed with
the formal part of the ceremony, but after that was
concluded he showed an indifferent feeling, and had
it not been for the state character of the doing, there
might have seemed to be even less cordiality. Ikamon,
of course, outdid himself, particularly in an
effort to impress the bride with his own importance,
and his squeaking voice and glancing eyes were everywhere
in evidence. Tetsutaisho was also pleased
and, at first sight of the bride, became so infatuated
that she did not thereafter lack attention: an unadvised
observer might even have taken him to be the
bridegroom.</p>

<p class="indent">This gallant young officer naturally was charmed
with Nehachibana upon his arrival and introduction
early in the evening, and certainly would have continued
his attentions had she been the last to come
upon the scene. As it was, and as he was unable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
to divide his gallantry between two, Takara received
his favours after their first meeting, which, strange
to say, seemed mutually agreeable. On the other
hand, Nehachibana had been not unfavourably impressed
with Tetsutaisho, and were it not that Takara
was now her sister-in-law she might have been a little
jealous. Shibusawa, however, consoled her with
more than his usual ardour, and he may not have
neglected to express in some measure his opinion of
the would-be seducer. At all events, he was under
the circumstances perfectly willing that the latter
should make haste with his wife rather than with his
sister. Nor did he disclose the cause of his indifference
about the one and his coldness toward the other,
because he felt that he had best let events take their
own course, especially that the position of both
would save either from bringing disgrace into his
family.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I do not mind saying,&#148; said he to his sister, as
they sat quietly together, &#147;that I am not at all
pleased with Tetsutaisho&#146;s appearance. More I do
not care to venture.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But he is so large and so heroic,&#148; answered
Nehachibana. &#147;Do not such men fight fiercely?
And have they not warm hearts? And are they not
chivalrous? But he does not seem to care for me.
Only Takara has saved him from being bored.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Such men are neither bored nor saved. They are
incapable of the one and beyond hope of the other,&#148;
replied Shibusawa, mindful of his own experience.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I trust so,&#148; mused she, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And I am&#151;well, except for you, indifferent as
to the whole affair,&#148; said he, as he arose and went
toward Takara.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
Shibusawa soon returned to his sister, and bowing
himself away from her retired from the company,
going with the full consciousness of having acquitted
himself as best he could under the circumstances.
Perhaps, as he lingered on the veranda above, he did
not think of Kinsan, more likely he did not notice
particularly the group of sight-seers in the road at the
front of the house, but if he had, he might have seen
her there, and have observed that her eyes were filled
with tears; that she trembled a little and that suspicion
was trying hard to enter her heart. He did
not distinguish her, however, but turned and went
into his own chamber and was seen no more that
night.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan, though, had recognised him, and when he
had gone she too turned and stole away toward her
house as silently as she had come, but with a heavy
heart and uncertain step.</p>

<p class="indent">From the time Kinsan had first heard of the intended
wedding, something told her that she must
go there. True, she had no reason for believing that
the Shibusawa to whom she had given her love was
a prince, or that he could possibly be the suitor of
Takara, the mikado&#146;s daughter; yet a power not
explained moved her to go, and opportunity enabled
her to see only too much. She had seen him there,
and in that she surmised an insurmountable gulf
between them, and felt that he in such a station,
however true, must be lost to her. She went home
and with an aching heart prayed for future light and
strength.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br/>
THE WEDDING FEAST</h2>

<p class="indent">On the third day after the wedding, all preparations
having been made, the newly wedded
couple started upon their bridal tour to the home of
the bride&#146;s parents. This was no small undertaking,
and to any other than a bride it would have seemed
decidedly unpleasant. The only means of transit
was by chair, and, as she had just been borne over
the same route and had in prospect a speedy return,
Takara might well have complained of the three
long journeys, if not of custom.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon coming to the wedding ceremony the bride
had brought with her a large number of useful and
costly presents, and, as might be expected, the family
of the bridegroom had been exceedingly liberal in
bestowing a return compliment. Maido had spared
neither pains nor expense to laden Shibusawa&#146;s train
with tokens of his appreciation, and as squad after
squad of carriers passed out at the front gate the
gathering onlookers cheered with something like
frenzy. It was, therefore, late in the morning before
the last of the baggage had passed and the way was
made clear for Shibusawa&#146;s chair, and as he came
forward there arose a mighty shout of &#147;Long live the
prince.&#148; Early in the day the kaika (household
treasurer), acting under Ikamon&#146;s instructions, had
begun distributing coins among the hangers-on, and
now that the noble suite was passing a perfect shower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
of &#147;cash&#148; was thrown upon them. No other means
could so readily call forth their hearty applause, and
Ikamon was gratified and Maido perhaps pleased, if
Shibusawa was entirely unconcerned.</p>

<p class="indent">As Shibusawa&#146;s chair swung into the roadway he
drew back the curtain and looked out at the excited
throng. There was one who stood, amid all this
noise, with a strained, eager expression. It was
Kinsan; and Shibusawa, looking straight into her
face, without offering to recognise her, closed the
curtain and continued his way. Probably she knew
as well as he that the least sign of recognition on his
part might, if detected, bring horrible punishment,
or even death to her. Possibly she believed him
cruel. Whatever her thoughts may have been, she
felt crushed and forlorn. She knew now that it was
only too true; that her heart was broken and her life
for ever shadowed.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan had gone there again to determine if possible
the truth or falsity of her former conviction.
Without any consciousness she had done her hair
in the prettiest fashion and dressed in her very best
kimono, and so anxious was she that before the sun
had barely risen she began planning to go. The fresh
air and the excitement brought the colour to her
cheeks, and when Tetsutaisho chanced to pass her,
on his way to wish Takara a safe journey and a speedy
return, he stopped and spoke to her and chided her
for being so far from home. She made no answer,
but his kindly attention lingered on her mind, and
possibly she may have contrasted this with Shibusawa&#146;s
greeting.</p>

<p class="indent">However, Kinsan was not so ready to heed the one
or condemn the other, and with a determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
stronger than ever she proceeded on her way home.
She had not gone far, though, before she was overtaken
by Tetsutaisho, who hastened to her and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Which way are you going now, my pretty young
lady?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan started at the sound of his voice, and when
she turned about and saw who it was, she blushed
deeply, then grew pale. She made no immediate
answer, but stood debating in her own mind what
she had best do; and as she made no offer to move
he became emboldened, and, coming closer, began
to talk in a confidential manner:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Come, my sweet little girl, come with me and sit
in the shade over there, where it is quiet and out of
reach of the curious.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I thank you, honourable sir, I am on the way
to my house and I wish not to delay, for that would
be improper. Please, sir, excuse me&#151;my mother
has said nothing about this proposal.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But,&#148; said he, &#147;I will pay the mother. I will
double and treble the price. Come with me now.
My bungalow is large and you shall share the privileged
mat. I am rich and my station is high. I will
free your father and mother from all their debts and
make them comfortable and happy. Come, now; what
more can be done? Is not all this worth the while?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan listened to all he said. She measured well
his proposals and thought of the ease and comfort it
would bring to her parents.</p>

<p class="indent">She also remembered that look of Shibusawa&#146;s
and how her heart had failed her; and then her love
for him began to reassert itself, and she turned upon
her enticer and scorned him, and without saying another
word walked rapidly away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
After Shibusawa had so coldly turned from Kinsan,
while passing through the gate and into the roadway,
he sank back in his chair, stunned and fearful. The
shock had overcome him, and he did not recover
until he had gone far beyond her reach. It was only
a glance, yet he now appreciated the force with which
that must have stricken Kinsan. While, as he well
knew, there could have been no escaping the consequences
of an overt act, nevertheless, had he done no
more he might in some way have sought Kinsan and
explained to her the true circumstances of his situation.
And now that he had not done so, and fully
realised the sad mistake, it was only with much self-control
that he held himself from attempting to
return to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing further marked his progress, and the visit
at Kyoto was a great success in spite of Shibusawa&#146;s
preoccupied state of mind. His reserve gave him an
air of dignity and charm of manner that surprised
and pleased the too much coddled mikado, who
could not help admiring the young man&#146;s strong,
athletic build and evenly balanced temperament.
Here at last was one who frowned upon frivolity and
seemed to exemplify real manhood; who aimed at
something above sordid pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara, too, was proud of her husband, and had
already begun to look up to him and to feel the force
of his character. Yet something she had hoped and
longed for was missing. All her maiden life she had
dreamed of this one sweet satisfying thing, and it was
still an unrealised thought.</p>

<p class="indent">They did not remain at Kyoto longer than etiquette
required, though in that time Shibusawa saw
something of the life and manners at the royal abode.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
He came in contact with not only the immediate
members of the family but some of the mikado&#146;s
most intimate advisers and a multitude of his well-paid
admirers, and therefrom formed some notion of
the prodigality if not unwisdom of such a duplicity
of government. Returning they went by way of
Kanazawa, where Takara was very much impressed
with the magnificence of her father-in-law&#146;s estates,
the prospective seat of her husband&#146;s future empire.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, what a beautiful place, and such a grand
scene!&#148; said she, with rapture, as they approached
the family mansion at the summit of the hill. &#147;And
the lovely breeze, and the stately pines, and all the
beautiful things which Kami has given us&#151;here
you will be my lover, and I, oh, how I shall love you!
Yes, I will love you, love you, oh, so much!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa did not answer, but for the first time
recognised her full nature, and presaged the consequence
of his failure. Nor did he venture to speak
and in some measure unfold the true state of his
feelings until the day before their final departure for
Tokyo. She had waited for him and longed for him,
and now somewhat of despair if not disgust had taken
hold of her. They were sitting side by side on the
matted floor, and from the open side could see afar
over the wind-tossed deep or out at the timbered hills
looming in the background.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Takara,&#148; said he, after a long silence, &#147;you are a
patient, noble woman. You deserve a better appreciation
than I can give you. Our connection is the
result of a false tradition, a perverted truth. Ambition
is the sponsor and necessity the maker of this
cruel situation, and in order that we may not suffer
therefrom let us be wise.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
With the first sound of Shibusawa&#146;s voice Takara
brightened with encouragement, but as he proceeded
her ardour cooled; and when she came to measure him
in the light of a starved sensibility there dawned upon
her a full appreciation of their true relation, though
she did not hasten to answer nor did she shrink in the
least from him. She only sat toying with a loose
obi (sash); finally it occurred to her to speak, and
she said with a sigh:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shibusawa, you just now made me happy, when
for the first time you spoke my name. Though only
a short happiness, it momentarily filled me with the
pride that comes not of unchaste wedlock. It would
have satisfied me to feel that you knew this if nothing
more. It is a little thing, yet a priceless jewel in the
crown of perfect womanhood. This privilege is
denied me and a more convenient one granted.
Sorrow is my reward; wisdom could have served me
no worse.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing further was said to mar the pleasure of
their visit at Kanazawa or the remainder of the
journey, and when they had safely arrived at Tokyo
they found themselves in a mood to enjoy a brief
interval of rest before the giving of the grand final
entertainment. This sumptuous affair was supposed
to be given under the immediate auspices of
the contracting parties themselves, but in this case
it had been made the special business of the redoubtable
Ikamon. And so well did he manage that
Maido indulged a lavish generosity, and even the
shogun expressed a sincere appreciation. Invitations
had been issued to all of the shogun&#146;s court and
the royal court, and to such of the nobility as were
in sympathy or could in any manner be accounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
influential or desirable. An effort was made to bring
together all the dignitaries and supporters of state
as well as the beauty and fashion of the land; to
inaugurate a better understanding between the two
parties and bring as far as possible the malcontented
literati under the influence of the shogun; and, of
course, incidentally, to advance Ikamon and his
friends wherever and whenever convenient.</p>

<p class="indent">The night of July 7th had been set for the festivities,
and when that evening came the grounds were
resplendent with lighted lanterns and the banquet
halls were festooned with vine and blossom. The
beautiful foliage, the brilliant lights, the fragrant
flowers, the lacquered walls, the spotless floors, the
embroidered screens, the simple ornaments, all combined
to make a scene of beauty and inspire a hearty
good will.</p>

<p class="indent">The feast had employed the highest art and the
ransacking of every market for rare foods and choice
viands. The delicate cooking and exquisite flavouring
proclaimed the finest culinary art, while the mild
tea and rich liquor evinced an exactness of curing
and perfection of brewing that might well rank
Maido&#146;s workers and artisans in the highest class of
perfection. The dinner in its almost endless round
of courses represented the very acme of human endeavour,
tastes, and desires covering an unbroken
period of over a thousand years of polite and civil
life, and might well be the joy of a people who in the
nicety of its conception and the beauty of its creation
stands for all time as a model to the world.</p>

<p class="indent">A thousand dancing girls, with embroidered gowns,
reeled hither and thither over the noiseless floor,
tripping time to strangely harmonious and sweet-sounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
instruments, while the guests mingled and
the feast progressed. The hour was neither early nor
late. The night was warm. Not a leaf stirred. No
sound rose from without. Then suddenly there came
the cannon&#146;s roar, a blinding flash. The startled
throng sprang up and stared blankly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is Hoti, god of good will, brandishing his
heavenly sword and beating the mighty drum,
Sekegakara,&#148; they cried in one accord, as they recovered,
and ran from one to another, talking and laughing
the event away. &#147;How silly to take fright!
Let us be merry! Now and for ever!&#148; rang out,
sounding anew the dash of pomp, the march of joy.</p>

<p class="indent">Then again and again the threatening voice broke
upon the still air, telling them that a new agency,
the force of a friendly foe, was at their door, bidding
them hearken. With each discharge their fears grew,
until bitterness and hate burst forth in determinate
unison:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Foreign devil!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It was all they could say; it was enough. Yet in
all that excitement there were two who more than
others controlled their emotions, and set about calmly
to dissuade hasty and ill-advised action. From the
firing of Commodore Perry&#146;s first shot Ikamon divined
its certain meaning; and before the old <i>Susquehanna</i>
had ceased sounding her notes of warning he had
begun to evolve a plan for his own aggrandisement.
Therefore, while others fell upon one another in loud
appeals to the gods, he moved quietly among them,
foretelling the true character of the strange visitation.
It was quite different, however, with Tetsutaisho,
for at the first sound of firing he fell upon his
knees in the midst of a coterie of admirers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
between gesticulating with his arms and beating his
head upon the floor prayed first to one god, then
another, to drive away the unforeseen and save them
from an untimely end. Whether it be earthquake
or &#147;foreign devil&#148; mattered not to him so long as
their women be spared and their honour maintained,
though when understanding finally dawned he suddenly
changed face and began strutting around in
a boastful manner, vowing the enemy all sorts of
speedy overthrowings and fatal exterminations.</p>

<p class="indent">Between Ikamon&#146;s expounding and Tetsutaisho&#146;s
boasting there was left little place for speculation,
yet there was one, young as he was, who gave himself
over to calm reason. Shibusawa not only judged,
but observed as well. Before the conclusion of the
first salute from the little squadron in the harbour
he had realised that the spirit of the entertainment
was broken; and before the last began, saw that the
guests were departing, some politely though all in
haste. The few who had the right were hastening
to the citadel, while others sought elsewhere the most
advantageous points of observation; therefore Shibusawa
embraced the earliest opportunity to withdraw,
and retired directly to his own rooms.</p>

<p class="indent">From the lower side of his chamber he could see out
across the harbour to where the strange vessels were
being placed at anchor. The grey hulls of the little
squadron lay broadside to the city, and their long
rows of mysterious lights shone brightly against the
dark background. Rumour had pictured these castles
of the deep, though few in this sacred land had known
or seen them in reality. The sight was an inspiring
one, and when the final salute began Shibusawa&#146;s
spirit rose, and as volley after volley rang out against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
the still, cool air of night his patriotism stirred him
to grand, uplifting thoughts. Here at last was a
force unknown to them; a power beyond their comprehension;
a god to be reckoned with.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not stand there long, but in that time fully
resolved what he himself should do. It was a moment
for serious thought, and in it there came to him a
world of possibilities. There was no need for him
in the council chamber; he had not yet assumed the
responsibilities of state. His place in the family
was that of a makeshift, and his true voice unheeded.
Why not go out into the world and there gain that
knowledge which would satisfy his thirst and possibly
in some measure enable him to preserve the happiness
of his own people? Yes; here was an opportunity;
he must go, he would go, come what might.</p>

<p class="indent">And then he thought of Kinsan. Would she
understand him? He must see her, and explain.
He would reassure her, and gain her consent. Then,
and not until then, there would be no obstacle in
the way of his highest ambition. But how could
he reach her? and would she hear him?</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah,&#148; said he, to himself, &#147;I have it. She will
be at the cave;&#151;she is there now;&#151;it is her only
lookout, and she too may have seen this beautiful
sight. The whole place is roused, and by this time
on the move. If my ears serve me right, even the
shogun is trying to make his way to the citadel!
I shall have no trouble about entering at the gate,
and will find her. I must go.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">His mind once made up he lost no time, but made
ready and hurried away. Outside the castle grounds
he found everything in confusion; a few lingered in
front, others tramped up and down, some going, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
coming, and all were in a state of feverish anxiety.
At times almost an uncontrollable impulse to join
in with the rest took hold of him, yet he did not yield
but kept steadfastly to his purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa soon arrived at the cave, but to his dismay
found it unoccupied. He sat down, and pondered.
Presently he looked out over the vast expanse
of tiled and thatched roof, and as his eyes lingered
he comprehended the full measure of its content.
There was at their door a force which proclaimed a
greater, a grander civilisation, and could he but
reach the seat of its activities he might know and
determine its character. But was such a thing possible?
He knew of no means; not even whence they
came or what were their necessities. Yet those
monsters of the deep must hail from somewhere, and
could he but put himself on board without detection
he would be carried thither. Whether they possessed
a like means of subsistence he did not know;
tradition did not tell him that, but he did know that
the sea and the air contained food such as he required,
and so long as they did not go beyond these he felt
reasonably sure of being able to provide for himself.
His very finger tips tingled with expectation&#151;but
Kinsan arose in his mind and he half whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, I cannot, must not go without first seeing
her. It is my duty, her right.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he started off and, not knowing just where
to go, unconsciously turned toward Kinsan&#146;s house,
opposite to whence he came. A flight of less than a
half dozen steps led down a small declivity, and when
he had nearly reached the bottom he almost stumbled
upon Kinsan, who lay, with her hands folded, crouching
upon the lower step. He stooped quietly over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
her and whispered, &#147;Kinsan,&#148; but she did not answer
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She is sleeping,&#148; thought he, &#147;and I will sit here
at her side until she has awakened. The pause will
give me time to choose the words, and her presence
the courage to speak.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The warm breeze fanned and soothed, and the still,
clear night inspired him. His mind ran on and out
until transported into boundless fancy. The earth,
the sun, the moon, and the stars were not of his
world. All were in the great abyss beyond. He
spoke, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Where?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">A voice answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;At my side.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;At the side of whom?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The voice said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Love.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked. The darkness disappeared, and a flood
of light streamed around them and away into limitless
space. He said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I have found the Light.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">And she whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are my god.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan had arisen, and together they walked into
the cave, and there sat and looked and talked and
reasoned for a long time.</p>

<p class="indent">Not so very long before Shibusawa&#146;s arrival at the
cave a mysterious voice had called Kinsan, and she
had gone there, kneeling at the stone steps as she had
knelt and prayed since their last meeting. From
that time she had not entered the enclosure, but held
it as a place sacred even to her. It was the throne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
upon which sat her love, her life, her god. There she
could not enter, but at his feet she was wont to kneel
and pray that he be saved, that the light return, and
that he proclaim her his own, his goddess love.</p>

<p class="indent">It was long after midnight when Shibusawa and
Kinsan fully understood each other and again pledged
their faith and vowed their never-ending love: when
the stars witnessed their seal, and they parted and
went according to their destined way.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br/>
THE STOWAWAYS</h2>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa ran toward his house with a fleet
foot and a light heart. He had fully made up his
mind to go if possible on board one of the strange ships
and sail away with the fleet. Whither he did not
know; nor did he consider when or how he should be
able to return. These were trifles with which he did
not concern himself, for the one person above all
others to whom his life was fully consecrated had
pledged her faith in his undertaking, and he proposed
boldly and resolutely to go forward into the dark
unknown.</p>

<p class="indent">His adventure might carry him into limitless space,
possibly land him upon the shores of another world;
or it might cross over the irresistible or emerge beyond
the impenetrable. The home of this strange people
might be the centre of a molten universe or the
frozen arc of an indescribable radius; whatever it
was, he had builded his hopes upon that faith which
invites us beyond the grave and makes life worth the
living.</p>

<p class="indent">With nothing more than a pilgrim outfit and what
seemed to him a goodly supply of ready money Shibusawa
and Okyo stole their way to the side of the
most convenient man-of-war. The day was just
breaking and the harbour already swarming with
sampans, filled and manned with the curiously inclined.
After a while with much bickering and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
bartering they succeeded in getting aboard, where
they were safely stowed away among the stokers
and lay anxiously awaiting the ship&#146;s departure.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meantime Commodore Perry had despatched
an early message to the shogun, requesting an immediate
audience with his duly accredited representative;
and as this request seemed to be backed by proper
credentials, and had been heralded by a strange, bold
display of force, the now thoroughly terrorised autocrat
of the flowery kingdom yielded a point and forthwith
directed the anxious but nowhere to be found
Ikamon to visit his grace, the Commodore, on board
his ship. Ikamon had disappeared! Maido was substituted,
and to the surprise of the hastily summoned
council and the chagrin of Tetsutaisho this conference
did not last more than an hour, while their rights
seemed arbitrarily decreed. The ambitious commander
had reduced his request to somewhat the form of
an ultimatum, which he politely delivered, promising
immediately to withdraw his ships, and in one year
return for an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">The purpose of the visit and the conditions of the
withdrawal alike remained unknown to Shibusawa,
who now lay wholly occupied with the strange,
mysterious things around him. He had not as yet
been missed on shore, for the excitement was great,
and his absence attracted no particular attention.
His father, like all the shogun&#146;s court, was busily
engaged with what seemed to him a threatening
danger. Takara gave herself very little concern
about him, and Nehachibana was already too well
employed with watching her recently affianced
Tetsutaisho.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore, when the white squadron filed out, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
those on shore breathed a token of relief, and were
happy for the departure, except perchance one at
the hidden cave, whose gladness sprang only from
her faith. She stood there pondering and watching
until the last ship had passed from sight, and then
she turned with a sigh to the place which had brought
her such joy only because of the pain. Kinsan returned
that morning to her home a happier woman.
She had met life&#146;s first severe trial and had stood the
test and won the battle, for she now knew the power
of faith.</p>

<p class="indent">Before leaving home Shibusawa had penned a
short message to his father, and one to his wife. He
informed Takara that he should be absent for a long
time, and advised her to seek such happiness as she
herself might find. To his father he explained more
fully his departure, his intentions, and his hopes.
Again he urged Maido to accept the situation, feel
assured of his safety, and fully confide in his purposes.</p>

<p class="indent">As the ship rolled out upon the great ocean Shibusawa
gained a parting glimpse of his native land, and
there came over him, only for an instant, a feeling
of awe mingled with something of regret. Then he
dismissed the past and thenceforth looked only to
the future.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br/>
CAST ADRIFT</h2>

<p class="indent">Upon sailing out into the open water the little
squadron encountered calm weather and a
smooth sea, and as they had taken the outside course
it was late at night before the Black Current was left
behind. The phosphorescent light danced and
played, while the air grew warm and balmy; though
Shibusawa since leaving sight of land ventured not
so high as a port-hole to enjoy the delights of a summer
night on the Eastern seas. In fact, the first relaxation
from the excitement of getting off, the swaying
of the ship, the warmth of the boilers, and the closeness
of the atmosphere combined to make him drowsy,
and he crawled forward and hid himself away between
great rolls of canvas, where he went fast asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did he after he had awakened attempt to stir
from his hiding-place until hunger and thirst had
driven him out. Then he came, blindly searching
for the one who had undertaken for an advance consideration
to &#147;stow&#148; and feed him and his companion
until the ship landed at Shanghai, its proposed destination.
And when he finally did after much confusion
find his provider he was surprised and mortified
at the treatment meted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Take that, Indian, and mind y&#146;u that &#145;mum is
the word&#146;,&#148; said the churlish stoker, as he tossed
him an old tin half filled with cold stew, earlier in the
day purloined from the mess.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
Shibusawa said nothing and took the food, though
not without a look of resentment. He did not understand
the words, but from the fellow&#146;s gruff manner
suspected something of his meaning. Those last
words, &#147;mum is the word,&#148; impressed him, and intuitively
he felt they in some way related to manner.
This he afterwards so thoroughly impressed upon
Okyo&#146;s mind that he, doubtful slave, learned no
more &#147;European,&#148; but made that much serve his
every purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Had Shibusawa been more politic, and accepted
the situation as a necessary consequence of his uncongenial
surroundings, he might have escaped further
insult, but that characteristic look of his gave the big,
sooty stoker further occasion to &#147;show off,&#148; whereat
he pounced upon him with his big bony hand in such
manner as to send his now bewildered charge sprawling
over the loose coals, saying, gruffly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ahoy wid y&#146;u! I&#146;ll teach y&#146;u to scud y&#146;r gang.
I&#146;ll take a reef in y&#146;r jib, y&#146;u blubberene!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa made no attempt to resist the attack,
but consoled himself in the belief that there were
others to be found in this strange civilisation that
were less impolite. He tried to relish the food,
though he could not bear its smell, much less its taste.
It was different cooking from any he had ever eaten,
and the seasoning&#151;well, it was no worse than the
ingredients, which he suspected to be mostly flesh of
some kind or another.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Can these strange people be cannibals? Yes,
they must be, else whence did they obtain this greasy
stuff?&#148; queried he, as he thought of his own fate.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa, however, had not started off entirely
unprepared, but upon leaving home had thrust into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
the folds of his girdle a few handfuls of loose rice and a
small skin of fresh water. Now that he was hungry
for food that he could eat and water that he could
drink he withdrew into a lonely corner and helped
himself sparingly. In the matter of clothing he was
more fortunate, for early upon his advent he had
succeeded in bargaining for a pair of blue overalls
and jumper, besides cowhide shoes and a sailor&#146;s cap.
For Okyo, he had as yet procured only a shirt and
the shoes&#151;the remainder being promised upon their
arrival at Shanghai. Thus the day passed, though
it was not later than four o&#146;clock when it began suddenly
to grow dark.</p>

<p class="indent">The air was becoming oppressive and the pressure
rapidly dropping. Presently the ship&#146;s men began
hurrying here and there under enforced orders, and
everywhere about there seemed a hushed, anxious
feeling. The barometer now registered 27,077 and
the captain took his place on the bridge. The
stokers&#146; shovels rang from below with the rhythm of
their merry &#147;he-ho,&#148; and the black clouds of smoke
rolled aft in her wake. The boatswain&#146;s hardy voice
rose high above the rattling of cordage and the planking
of hatchways. The half-hour bell solemnly
tolled, and a pall-like stillness settled over all as the
storm-centre lowered around them.</p>

<p class="indent">A hush, a whirl, a roar&#151;and the suspense was
over. The storm had burst, and the typhoon was
on. The head-on bell sounded and the grimy funnels
belched clouds of sparks, and the ponderous ship
hurled a foaming surf and furrowed the angry sea
like a demon waging a last defence. The fire flashed
and the heavens roared and rumbled, while every
man braced himself at his post. Sea after sea lashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
and drove upon her decks. Her cabins creaked
and her beams trembled. The breathless lurches,
the awful plunges, the terrific pounding, all told
of her mighty battle for life and of the uncertainty
of man&#146;s contention with the mad fury of the
elements.</p>

<p class="indent">In the midst of the awful storm Shibusawa became
deathly sick, and made a desperate effort to gain the
upper deck. Several times he had been discovered
and as often beaten back, but the want of fresh air
and the uncertainty of his position each time impelled
him to further effort. At last he succeeded
in reaching the open hatchway, and watching his
chance slipped by and clambered upon the open deck.
Here the wind caught him up and hurled him along
the slippery plank and headlong aft, where he lodged
in a tangled mass of d&#233;bris. A lone boatswain caught
him from going overboard, and in the hurry and
excitement lashed him to a life raft which had been
swept up by the last wave. The hardy fellow had
barely covered his own safety when another high sea
caught the ship abaft her starboard bow and swept
over her deck like a monstrous tidal wave.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Man overboard!&#148; cried the boatswain, as Shibusawa
and his life raft disappeared behind the
tumbling, heaving, jagged mountain, that rolled, and
moaned, and foamed in the distance.</p>

<p class="indent">His voice was lost in the din of wind and rain that
swept down from the bridge above.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;All under deck and make fast your hatchway!&#148;
shouted the captain, as the quartermaster tugged at
the helm&#146;s tangled gear.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;We must throw her into the trough of the sea,
mate, else we are lost,&#148; continued he, as the disabled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
apparatus failed to steer, and a swelling, growling
sea came speeding on.</p>

<p class="indent">A crash, a splash, and a shiver&#151;and the big ship
lay as if stunned, and debating whether after all life
is worth the trial. Then slowly she began to rise,
and the terrible suspense was over. Caged and fearful
men were now assured of her determination to
survive, and they loved and praised and trusted her.
There was no longer any doubt, but every soul would
have pledged his life that she would win the battle.
Rising again she rolled to starboard, as if bantering
her oncoming assailant for the second trial. This
one, larger, though calmer than the first, took her
amidship and heaved her over on her port side; then
as if unmindful rolled on and over the submerged
ship. Not a man lost his courage as she sank and
sank, and seemed to go farther and farther toward
the ghoulish bottom, but with each faint feeling there
came a responsive voice that rang with certainty:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She&#146;ll win, boys; just give her time.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she sank no more, but rested, as if satisfied
to venture no farther. Then she raised a little,
then more, and still more, until at last she leaped
upon the surface and bounded about like a cork on
the water. She had won, and the third wave pushed
her down, and dropped her broadside into the trough
of the sea. There she lay, and tossed at the water&#146;s
will until the morning of the second day, when the
typhoon had passed and the seas were again calm.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa&#146;s disappearance was lamented by none
but two. When cast adrift he was so blinded by the
spray and drenched with water that he could neither
see nor hear. Fortunately his frail raft did not capsize
but remained right side up, and he clung fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
with a tenacity possessed only by one who is in the
very jaws of horrible death. He was a good swimmer
and accustomed to the water, else he might not have
fared even so well as not to have been washed away.</p>

<p class="indent">All night long he drifted in the darkness, not knowing
where he was or just how he came to be there.
He knew nothing of such conditions and had never
heard of a similar circumstance, yet instinct told him
how best to make use of the slender means at hand;
necessity moved him to do so. The wind blew and
the seas lashed. He did not cry out, nor did he lose
courage, for he had resolved to meet his fate like a
man. Day came and passed and he was still alone.
Toward night the wind had gone down, and he could
relax his hold and ease his tired arms and numb
limbs. He quenched his thirst a bit from the skin
of water, which he still carried, and then ate sparingly
of the rice in his pocket. As the gloom began to
turn into darkness he for the last time stretched himself
and looked around, but could see nothing except
perilous waters. For many long hours he nerved
himself to the task, and not until the sun rose the
next morning did he succumb to the terrible exhaustion.
Then he sank down and saw no more, but
dreamed of Kinsan and of the rescue that soon would
save him from a watery grave.</p>

<p class="indent">It was about three o&#146;clock of that afternoon when the
<i>Fair Puget</i>, a lumber schooner from Puget Sound, hove
into sight on her return trip from Shanghai, where she
had recently discharged a cargo of timber. The trim
little ship was sailing under a fair wind and the veteran
captain, Thomas N. Thompson, was at the wheel.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Come here, Jack,&#148; said he to his lone mate, as he
knocked the ashes from a rusty box-elder pipe, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
he jammed into his grey trousers hip pocket. &#147;Try
the glasses on yon bit of drift, Jack, and see if y&#146;u
c&#146;n make out the like of it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack took the long, brass-trimmed, rust-stained
glasses and adjusted them to his widely set eyes,
threw his shoulders back and his middle forward,
and squinted with first one eye, then the other.
Presently he lowered the glasses and with much
deliberation drew from his washed-out overalls
pocket a long plug of navy, from which he calmly
bit a huge quid. He then raised the glasses a second
time, taking great pains as he did so to re-adjust and
fit them to the importance of the occasion. After
several times shifting his weight from one foot to the
other, he lowered the glasses and placed his arms
akimbo and said in an offhand manner:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I don&#146;t see nothin&#146;. I guess it&#146;s a log&#146;r two
adrift. Glad we don&#146;t have to reef in&#151;she&#146;s makin&#146;
a deuced good eight knots now, and I don&#146;t see no
let up ahe&#146;d.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;S&#146;p&#146;osin&#146; you give me a spell here&#146;t the wheel,
Jack, and let me take a squint on&#146;t. Somehow I
feel it in my bones&#151;feel&#146;t there&#146;s something more&#146;n
drift in that bunch,&#148; said Tom N., as he was familiarly
called over at the Blakely Mills, where he had been
getting charters since the first cargo left its port.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;All right, cap&#146;n. You&#146;re the judge, and I&#146;m not
objectin&#146;, so long as we don&#146;t have to heave to. It
&#146;u&#146;d be a tarnation pity to spile this beautiful head
on&#151;you know we&#146;re already short on time. That
whirler was a corker, wan&#146;t she, cap&#146;n?&#148; said the easygoing
fellow, as he spattered the deck with fresh
tobacco juice and toyed with the wheel, which stood
loosely wound at his side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
&#147;Jack,&#148; said the captain, presently, with a feeling
of great satisfaction, &#147;there&#146;s something besides
&#145;still life&#146; in that heap, if I&#146;m not mightily mistaken.
See that school of shark round there?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Are y&#146;u sure them&#146;s not dog fish, cap&#146;n?&#148; queried
the pretending mate, who was still anxious to make
good use of a favourable wind, if not to avoid hauling
in the sails.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yep; they&#146;re shark, sure enough,&#148; continued the
captain, now more certain than ever. &#147;I guess we&#146;ll
have to haul to, mate. It won&#146;t do to pass somethin&#146;
in distress&#151;not so long as Tom N. is the poop
sheik of a gig sloop. Not on your life, mate! And
who knows but one of us&#146;ll be the very next to man
a like un&#146;?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, I s&#146;pose it&#146;s the order, then?&#148; said Jack,
gloomily. &#147;I&#146;ll bet, though, it&#146;s nothin&#146; more&#146;n a
&#145;Jap,&#146; even if we do heave to.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack lost no time in putting the men to work, and,
as usual, when he went at it in earnest the thing
was soon done. The little three-master was brought
to, not far distant from the floating drift, which now
plainly disclosed the form of a man. The excitement
began to grow intense, and Jack&#146;s ponderous
voice could have been heard for miles around as he
and two trustys jumped into the lifeboat and yelled:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Swing to the davits and let go your blocks!&#148;
Thereafter no time was lost in getting the shipwrecked
man on board, and in applying the necessary
restoratives; though it was some time before
Shibusawa fully recovered consciousness, and when
he did so they were again under full sail for Port
Blakely, Washington.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br/>
A WOMAN&#146;S PRIVILEGE</h2>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa&#146;s being washed overboard left Okyo
a helpless and penniless victim. For nearly two
days he managed to escape being burned alive in the
firebox, by the angry stoker, who was now determined
to rid himself of the fruitless charge. Through
fright and exposure and hunger he had become so
nearly dumb that when discovered and questioned
he could say nothing but &#147;mum is the word.&#148; Then
he was taken on deck and offered food and water,
and as a matter of safety placed in the guard house,
where he remained until the ship landed at Shanghai.</p>

<p class="indent">Here he was detained until an opportunity came
to return him to his native land, and when he had
finally arrived in Tokyo, some two months later, he
was still unable to make any explanation of his condition
or experiences. Maido tried by every means
to elicit some word from him that might throw light
upon the whereabouts or safety of his son. All his
efforts were of no avail, and the only thing possible
for Okyo to say was:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Mum is the word.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Okyo&#146;s hapless predicament&#151;which led Maido
to think it possible that his son had met a like fate,
or even a worse one&#151;wore heavily upon the already
overburdened daimyo. Since the landing of Commodore
Perry&#146;s fleet, matters of state were becoming
more and more strained. Every day brought new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
charges and counter charges of the one party against
the other. Contrary to Ikamon&#146;s promises the
literati had not been quelled, but were again fast
gaining strength throughout the south, and even the
mikado himself was becoming not averse to listening
to their bitter complaints, if not to their proposed
radical changes. Though Maido was becoming sick
at heart and weak of purpose he could not, much as
he desired to do so, extricate himself from the tangled
net that dragged at the home or in the state. Old
tactics and new sorrows were little calculated to bring
him that peace of mind and ease of heart to which
he had all his life looked forward, and Shibusawa&#146;s
absence had come to be not only the source of deepest
regret but the cause of nervous, restless anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon&#146;s schemes, also, were weighing Maido down
with uncertainty; forcing him into a retirement shorn
of every consolation saving only Nehachibana. She
soothed him and cheered him and he worshipped her,
yet this last and only comfort was soon to be snatched
away. Nehachibana, too, was suddenly to fall a
victim to Ikamon&#146;s base desires, to Tetsutaisho&#146;s
insatiate thirst. Maido&#146;s consent was wrung out of
him and his daughter torn from him, and when on
a dark, dreary day early in September she was carried
away the old man broke down and wept bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You, too, Nehachibana,&#148; were the only words,
as the bridal train left, and wended its way toward
Tetsutaisho&#146;s father&#146;s house, where the eager bridegroom
waited this, the coming of his latest prey.</p>

<p class="indent">They were married, and Nehachibana was loved
only till abandoned to the ill-usage of a tyrannical
mother-in-law. The Tetsutaishos belonged to the
samurai class and as such were permitted a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
living within the outer moat. Tetsutaisho was next
to the youngest of seven children&#151;an elder brother
and five sisters. The father had never risen in the
ranks, but owing to dissipation and over-indulgence
had reached a state of worthlessness which deprived
him of all social standing and reduced his income to
the barest necessities. The eldest son had grown
up a useless appendage to an already declining family,
and his time was frittered away at playing &#147;go&#148; or
in hanging about at the wrestling matches. The
girls had been at an early age regularly sold into
their kind of slavery, and in such manner the family
managed barely to subsist until Tetsutaisho&#146;s fortunes
began to rise.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of this one&#146;s coarse breeding and fallen
rank there was something about him which appealed
to his superiors. He was every inch a soldier, and
few there were who could snap a bow or flash a steel
as he. From childhood he took a fancy to everything
military, and early in life had shown a disposition
to redeem a lost heritage and restore his family
to its proper rank and former prowess. However,
such a thing as executive ability was unknown to
him. His wants did not go beyond the hour, and
the matter of provision never entered his head. He
was hale and hearty, and a &#147;good fellow well met.&#148;
There were but two things which concerned him&#151;war
and women; the one his occupation, the other
his amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore, when Nehachibana came to his father&#146;s
home Tetsutaisho did not at all worry about the
kind or quality of dowry which she brought. It was
only her tender innocence that he coveted, and that
only for his enjoyment. For her he had no sympathy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
nothing to offer. She must take her place, as it was,
and be contented. He had not even thought of an
heir&#151;that was a thing which as yet had not occurred
to him, and thus it offered no encouragement to his
wife.</p>

<p class="indent">There was, notwithstanding, one in the family,
his mother, who had looked forward with a great deal
of interest to the coming of the bride&#146;s household
effects, particularly the presents, and as they arrived
and were unpacked she grumbled at each, no matter
what the kind or cost. Nothing pleased her, and
she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;They are fine enough, but lack in quality, I know.
And this Maido, who is he, that my son, my Tetsutaisho,
should so honour him as to take his daughter
in marriage? Is this what I am to get? And that
without a voice? Verily the hand of misfortune falls
heavily. Beauty and treasure&#151;rags and fiddlesticks!
A joros[<a href="#index10">10</a><a name="fn10" id="fn10"></a>] would have brought me good
returns. And what is this I hear all the time? Goddess
Benten?&#151;Nehachibana! Hist! Better try
your prayers on Kwannon. The goddess of mercy
is more likely your need: the goddess of love, your
wish.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;O my most honourable mother-in-law, O my
gracious Fukurokuju,&#148; said Nehachibana, meekly.
&#147;Myself I most humbly give you, for the god Oshaka
has willed it. May the god Daikaku smile fortune
upon you! My Benzaiten, my wealth surrender.
My Kaminaraba, my heart I gave. O Amida, I
pray you bring me always hard suffering if I
now or ever keep my mother-in-law in the least
ignorance.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well you may be proud to serve. Few wives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
have husbands who have mothers who are so
exceedingly blessed by the sweet, beautiful god of
good nature, Hoti,&#148; answered the vain mother-in-law.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I take my place with much appreciation, and I
now consecrate my life to the happy service of my
most lovely mother-in-law,&#148; said Nehachibana, bowing
low.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Scissors,&#148; said the other, while they both scowled
away.</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana&#146;s husband was at first exceedingly
attentive to her, and while he did not concern himself
about her troubles at home he rather felt that
he had gained a prize by taking Ikamon&#146;s advice and
marrying the daimyo&#146;s daughter. He soon discovered
that he had not only served a friend, but improved
his own chances; for, in these days when
disastrous clouds were forming so rapidly, any connection
which brooked a stronger alliance with a
house like that of Maido&#146;s meant certain favour to
those concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho, however, was not always over-sagacious,
and as time went on he began to exploit his
fortunes in other directions than at home. Kinsan
had managed to keep well out of his way and
therefore, though not forgotten, out of his mind.
Probably, also, he was somewhat lax in pressing his
fondness there because of the demands made upon his
attention by Takara, his rather ardent sister-in-law.
In fact, it was at Nehachibana&#146;s homegoing party
that he had first begun to feel something more than
a brotherly interest in the deep and unfathomable
wife of Shibusawa. And as they sat together there,
on the veranda, with now and then a falling leaf to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
remind them of the oncoming season, she looked unusually
pretty, and her rather sad, far-away look did
anything but lessen her attractiveness, as she looked
up to him and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you think me not enough composed for one
so newly married, Tetsutaisho?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, Takara,&#148; answered he, meditatively. &#147;I
was just remarking to myself how well you wore
the care. I&#146;ll venture his reward vouchsafes the
kindness.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I trust so.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He could only say as much.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will tell you sometime; I must go now&#151;Nehachibana
is waiting for me. See her&#151;she is actually
coming toward us.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why, Nehachibana,&#148; continued he, speaking to
his wife, &#147;you really look a trifle jealous. How now,
my beauty treasure?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, no; she&#146;s not jealous,&#148; said Takara, quickly
divining the situation; &#147;only men have the right to
be jealous, women the privilege.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, Takara! How you do talk!&#148; said Nehachibana,
flushed and gladdened. &#147;I should lose my
tongue were I to scold like that. I know I should.
No man would have the patience with me, much less
would my husband.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nehachibana is right,&#148; said Tetsutaisho, consolingly.
&#147;A man regards, and a husband disregards.
And why not? Come, my little wife, let us be off
and away. There be times when even virtue has not
its reward.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Takara gracefully yielded to the unpleasant interruption,
and for a week or more no further intercourse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
was had with Tetsutaisho. He became suddenly so
enrapt with Nehachibana that for the time being he
forgot all about Takara and the innocent flush which
had come to her cheeks in speaking of marriage and
its attendant influences. It was not so with Takara.
She remembered well his words and how he
brightened with interest at her every whim and
fancy; then she thought of how happy Nehachibana
must be.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am not jealous,&#148; said she to herself, time and
time again. &#147;It is only Nehachibana. I do not
know such a thing; only other women are jealous.
I wonder why? Nor do I envy anybody. I only
wish Shibusawa were like Tetsutaisho. How I would
love him&#151;love him, oh, love him!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Often her feelings ran on and on until she fancied
her own husband the hero of her life. No taint had
ever entered her heart. She believed him the master
of her destiny and the fulfilment of her fortunes.
Then Tetsutaisho came again, toward the latter part
of September, and she was not displeased with his
courtesies. He had come at the instance of Ikamon
to talk over the matter of the shogun&#146;s successor&#151;that
Iyeyoshi was now ill and there seemed to be no
hope of his recovery&#151;but, presently he came, there
arrived a message for Maido to appear forthwith at
a council meeting (prefacing the expected), at which
the grief-stricken daimyo hurried away, leaving the
young and careless general there to entertain the
ladies or idle away his time at will.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a quiet afternoon and Tetsutaisho and
Takara wandered off beneath the falling leaves to
a sheltered place on the lawn. Takara was lonely.
She had had no friendships since Tetsutaisho&#146;s last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
visit except only Maido&#146;s, her father-in-law. To him
she was already beginning to be a comfort, and in
a measure to take the place of his lost daughter.
But it was an old man&#146;s friendship; and when the
younger gallant left her that evening she may have
bidden him welcome to return.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br/>
DANGER IN SHIBUSAWA&#146;S ABSENCE</h2>

<p class="indent">So far as Tetsutaisho was concerned he had called
at the daimyo&#146;s castle only by accident, though
there was much anxiety and probably no one&#146;s fortune
more at stake. Iyeyoshi had grown old and
inert amidst strained conditions, and appreciated
more fully than could Iyesada, his youthful successor,
the necessity of advancing the bold, heedless
young general. Nor was Tetsutaisho free from the
danger of rival aspirants; yet there was no war at
hand, and he knew of no better business than pleasing
Ikamon and paying respect to the ladies at court.</p>

<p class="indent">Here he need not concern himself with rivalry,
for the one guided with a jealous eye his rising place
and the other enjoyed without interruption his pleasing
address. He came and went at will, and had he
not sooner possessed an unknown love he might have
quicker formed an attachment. Takara responded
naturally to the voice of inevitable will, but a yearning
heart unconsciously bade him seek Kinsan.</p>

<p class="indent">Without neglecting the former, he pressed his suit
for the latter, and now more than ever became a
faithful caller at the modest cottage in the garden;
and as he persisted Kinsan determined and withdrew
patiently into the solitude of her unknown retreat,
and there conjured feelings of love that ripened
with each thought and strengthened in the face of
every danger. Filial affection bound her and crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
her, yet she was possessed of a new force, moved by
a deeper impulse. She battled with the inevitable
and yielded her life to what seemed to be the impossible;
no quarter was given, and fate tracked her even
to her last place of hope.</p>

<p class="indent">It was on a warm afternoon in early spring, when
the clouds overhung with threatening storm, that
Tetsutaisho, hurrying toward his home, wended his
way along the selfsame pathway, which led past
Kinsan&#146;s lonely spot on the hillside. As he came
into sight a gust of wind swept down the gully and
whipped his kimono close round his limbs. He
paused and looked overhead, but none too soon, for
large drops, falling straight and swift, warned him
of the rapidly approaching downpour.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;If I mistake not,&#148; said he, to himself, &#147;I shall
get a good drenching this time. I wonder what
shelter is that in the distance? If I could get there
without too much hobbling&#151;it is my only chance.
I shall venture.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">If he had but looked closer he might also have
seen Kinsan, who had gone there earlier in the day
to escape his presence at her house. However, she
saw him, and when he left the path she had so often
watched him tread her heart stood still and she
trembled with fright. He was surely coming, and
there was no possible means of escape. She appealed
not to the gods, but grasped at intuition; her
secret hiding-place offered an alternate, and quickly
entering she covered her safety as best she could.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho found his way there; and in time,
for it had not yet begun to rain, though great clouds
were massing and the sky was growing dark and
hollow. He entered the scant shelter with no concern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
about its past or thought of its significance.
It was a covering, and though dreary he faced about
and looked out at the grand panorama of mingled
peace and storm its outlook brought into view. He
stood with folded arms, likening the elements to a
marshalling of the samurai, in which he should sometime
startle the land and bring glory to himself.
And then he thought of Kinsan and of how she, too,
were she there would under such a spell acknowledge
his unalterable right. He straightened back and
marvelled at his greatness, while the lowering clouds
rumbled afar.</p>

<p class="indent">Then suddenly a submerged sneeze at his back
frightened him, and he wheeled about and peered
into the gloom at the dumb, bleak walls. He could
see no one, and suddenly it grew dark, and clashing
thunder broke overhead. Again he was startled by
the same mysterious sound, and he fell down and
cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is the ghost of Taira!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Scarcely had he uttered the words when the rain began
to pour, and the ghoulish sound once more started
him to his feet, and he ran out into the driving storm
and dashed down the hillside, toward his home, far beyond
the second moat. Here, soaked and exhausted,
he hid himself in his room and pondered deeply the
voice at the cave. The rain pounded overhead, and
in each corner there seemed lurking a spirit&#151;he
heard many sounds.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a warning, and the next day Tetsutaisho
was at the council chamber, early and faithful. He
heard Ikamon argue against change, and in favour
of continuance; comprehended his meaning, that
natural growth is the law of the gods; and agreed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
with his charge, that nothing short of revolution
could overthrow a system that followed regular,
active, inherent growth.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What,&#148; said the prime minister, with squeaking
voice and expressionless face, &#147;would you have us
do? Change our course now that the storm drives
at our front and the breakers rise behind us? Would
you at mid-stream change this good old ship, that
has weathered the storm of ages, for one that is new
and untried? No; a thousand times no! and may
such men as Maido, Saigo, Katsu, Tetsutaisho, and&#151;if
I may be permitted&#151;Ikamon, live to helm her
safely into port. Iyesada, brave captain that he is,
cannot afford to man his ship with other than the
skilled and experienced, and where else can he find
them but at the post of duty? This is the plan which
I propose, and I call upon every loyal citizen, every
adherent of the august shogun, and every lover of
the divine mikado, to rally to my support.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">They came; the victory was his; and the shogun
more than ever in his power. Katsu was soon thereafter
placed at the head of the navy, and Tetsutaisho
advanced to the command of the army. It was the
reward his friends had given him for his loyalty, and
he took the advancement as a matter of course, not
even deigning to return thanks or offer a promise.
So far as he was concerned his friends were his fortune,
and even the law of the land had no place as
between him and them.</p>

<p class="indent">Under Ikamon&#146;s domination Tetsutaisho was relieved
of the necessity for any particular state activities,
while his promotion had placed him socially
at the head of the samurai, as had his marriage to
Nehachibana raised him in esteem among the nobility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
and given him standing at court. The state
furnished him with luxuriant quarters, where he
domiciled his family, under the immediate sway of
his fault-finding mother, with Nehachibana as her
patient, industrious slave. Time passed leisurely,
and as he had long ago forgotten his desperate resolve
he was wont more than ever to make regular calls
at his father-in-law&#146;s house.</p>

<p class="indent">As these visits grew in frequency, the length of his
stay became less guarded; and Takara, at first looking
upon his coming as a pleasing incident, recurring
now and then in her monotonous life, welcomed him,
then looked for him, and now, that his had come to
be her only true companionship, longed for his
coming.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You will come to-morrow, will you not, Tetsutaisho?&#148;
said she, with pleading, wistful eyes, as he
was about to leave her on a warm, inviting night in
June.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, Takara,&#148; answered he, softly and earnestly.
&#147;I will come over, and together we will watch the
second sailing of Perry&#146;s fleet, the departure of the
first man who ever dared profane our soil. I understand
the arrant braggart has finally wrung from
the shogun certain privileges that are not less dangerous
than disgraceful. As he came, he will go out:
booming his noisy guns. It will be a showy thing,
and possibly worth our seeing. I shall certainly
come, my lady, especially that it pleases you to have
me. And now, good-night, and pleasant dreams.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the following day Tetsutaisho once more
wandered over to the council and for a time hopelessly
endeavoured to share in the tumult occasioned
by the second appearance of the American fleet. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
was deeply impressed with the importance of the
proceedings, but diplomacy was not his business,
nor was it in keeping with his ideas of national honour,
much less official dignity or personal heroism. To
him Ikamon&#146;s subtle harangue had been quite as much
a bore as was the commodore&#146;s demand a bold and
hollow bluff. Had he had his way he would have
invited the meddlesome foreigner to come ashore and
inspect the samurai before undertaking to establish
in their midst any sort of commercial theft. But
Tetsutaisho&#146;s voice as yet had no weight in the
chamber, and he knew it and was satisfied. Withdrawing
presently, he returned homeward and prepared
himself for a more pleasing diversion.</p>

<p class="indent">Toward evening the weather grew warm and
inviting, and Tetsutaisho strolled over to Takara&#146;s
house early, where they loitered on the veranda and
supped long at their tea. There was that stillness
in the air that begets confidence, and the moon rose
clear and bright. He sat smoking and dreaming,
and she chatted away or toyed with the tiny cup in
front. He had finished his pipe, then he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shall we stroll over to the arbour vine, Takara?
The woods are inviting, and there we can get a glimpse
of the &#145;Yankee&#146; as he hurls our foam at his back.
Come, my lady, shall I assist you to rise?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Takara drooped her eyes and blushed, and he did
not resist the temptation, but sat at her side and
took her willing hand in his. She leaned forward,
and looking into his upturned face revealed the
answer. Nothing could stay or mar that pleasure.
They sat there enrapt with the joy of all time: only
the stars gave witness, and when they had awakened
there was no need for a scene in the moonlight, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
a crossing of the ways, for a going into the halo of
life; they had sooner found their affinity, and all the
glories of heaven and earth could not transport them
more, and when they went out into the dawn it was
to revel in thoughts sweeter than dreamland had
ever revealed. A beautiful sunburst beamed from
her heart, and her eyes shone with a love that welcomes
the true; that fades and shuns at the false.
The fleet had long passed out, the moon had risen
high, and God had again proven the wisdom of all
things when those two returned and parted for the
night.</p>

<p class="indent">As Tetsutaisho hastened along the gravelled pathway
toward his home his step was less firm and his
purpose more uncertain than when he came. His
course had led him over the firmer hold and into the
boundless sea of uncertainty. What was once a
passion was now fast becoming a desire, and he knew
no such thought as halt. Whither he did not know,
perhaps he did not care, for to him the world was but
a reality: its pleasures were its eternity. And not
until he approached his own house did he think of
Nehachibana, and of how she had made his home
worth the while; of her waiting and watching and
praying for his return; of the boundless joy that
filled her heart at the first sound of his footsteps, and
then he said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;These wise old fathers of my country have fitted
well the act and made certain their provision for such
as she and I. The law makes marriage tolerable and
it makes love enjoyable. A thousand dry draughts
to you! May the laws live long, and love die never!
O Jurokin; O Benten; hear me!&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br/>
THE &#147;NO&#148; DANCE</h2>

<p class="indent">After the departure of Perry and his fleet
there was nothing of importance from the outside
world to disturb the quaint little kingdom, so
snugly hemmed in by the eastern waters. There
was no immediate necessity for any material change
at the newly made treaty ports, and in consequence
the administration made known only so much of
the terms of the compromise as it was thought would
satisfy the opposition. The people were left in doubt
as to its full purport, and thus they soon became
reconciled to a belief that after all the danger might
not be so great as at first supposed.</p>

<p class="indent">After the storm had passed there came a lull which
might have lasted indefinitely had Ikamon been more
sagacious in the treatment of local affairs. His sway
at home was now supreme, and his rule so effective
that he mistook complaisance for submission, and
as a result overlooked the slow but positive disaffection
in the south.</p>

<p class="indent">When the readjustment took place it was thought
that Saigo&#146;s reward and position would tend to allay
the discontent in that locality, and that an economic
policy would again restore the shogun to the full
confidence of all sections of the country. This was
true in a measure, but the patriots who worshipped at
the mikado&#146;s seat could not be effectively won over
by personal favours bestowed upon their leaders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
They were full of the soul of ancient times, and
nothing short of a complete restoration of conditions
could satisfy their rising spirits.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the shock of recent events had so checked
their growth as to give Ikamon a chance to centralise
his force and place Tetsutaisho at the head of a
consolidated army. In all these doings the young
general took no active part other than to hold himself
in readiness to strike when called upon, but in
the meantime gave himself up wholly to the delights
of a love that was inevitable, if without the pale.
Shibusawa continued to remain absent, and to all
but his father had become as if forgotten, while
Takara was now the favourite of the lord daimyo,
and the castle offered her every privilege as she
liked. Tetsutaisho was her slave, and she toyed with
him as with a child, coming regularly and remaining
at her will.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Let us go down by the summer garden,&#148; said she,
on a sultry afternoon in July, as they finished their
tea on the veranda. &#147;There by the pond where the
snow-white cranes stalk silently about or lazily tuck
their sacred heads; under the rose-covered retreat
that juts out over the iris-flagged waters. How I
do love to sit there and be your idle-thought!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am glad you proposed it. I will call the carriers
and we will take the norimonos (chairs) down.
It is too hot to walk this day,&#148; answered he, glad of
the chance.</p>

<p class="indent">Having in a little while arrived at the chosen retreat
they lounged on the matted floor amidst the fragrance
of the lotus and in view of the iris-studded waters
in front. A cool breeze gently floated in, and now and
then a golden crane crossed in the wake of his abode.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
&#147;I wish I were a bird,&#148; said Takara, dreamily.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then I should be your mate,&#148; answered Tetsutaisho,
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And this our nest,&#148; whispered she.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Our paradise,&#148; said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And if it were,&#148; continued Takara, &#147;we would
live here for ever, and there would be no parting and
no improprieties. I do hate a world where one must
suffer to be happy! Kamie has given us all these
beautiful things and has made us to love, and naughty
man has tried to upset it all and make us creatures
of his convenience. I, for one, propose to consult
more my own pleasure.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Quite right you are, Takara; conventionality is a
thing I do not like so very well myself. Yet we ought
not to complain, for there is really nothing to prevent
us from making this our heaven. Who could ask
for a more lovely spot! And I assure you there is
neither man nor law to stand between us.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you think so?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is true. I know it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then I am content, for I have but a single
thought.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Just as the beautiful lotus which you see standing
here and there and all about. It is emblematic of
purity, which springs from single-mindedness; and
of virtue, because of its usefulness. You are just
like they, and I love them and I am going to love
you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And you always will?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;So long as Jurokin be a god.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">After a while they had said their say and, leaning
back on the rustic moulding, contented themselves
with looking out at the shadows falling across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
mirrored lake from the tall cypress standing on the
bank. Presently Takara broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Let us call the geishas; the water is so still and
the day suggestive. What do you say, Tetsutaisho?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A happy thought. And what shall it be?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I have but one choice.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The ancient dance?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; &#145;No.&#146;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho called and despatched a servant to
the shibai (house of entertainment) for Michizane,
the &#147;lover of the plum&#148; and poet to Takara, who
came forthwith and bowed, and then stood by, waiting
to be directed. Tetsutaisho first spoke, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Michizane, your lady would have you provide
some entertainment before the sun is set. She herself
will suggest the kind.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, Michizane,&#148; said she. &#147;Let it be &#145;no,&#146; the
dance of our fathers; then, if you like, a poem.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Michizane bowed and departed, though not with
a happy expression. Since her early childhood this
old man had faithfully provided Takara with innocent
amusement, which service, since his lady&#146;s
marriage to Shibusawa, consisted chiefly in reading
to her poems of his own creation. She had brought
him along from Kyoto as a necessary part of her
household effects, all of which belonged to an age
or a school not of the shogun&#146;s. He was now a
veteran of sixty years, and little calculated to compose
in a vein suited to his fair lady&#146;s taste, except
it be not when Tetsutaisho was so near by.</p>

<p class="indent">Michizane was not long, however, in arranging in
front of the &#147;lovers&#146; nest&#148; the covered float, upon
which there balanced a dozen and six&#151;one for each
half decade from birth to ninety&#151;of the fairest and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
loveliest of the geishas. These were arranged at
the rear of the platform in the form of a crescent,
beginning at the left with the youngest and ending
at the right with the oldest&#151;symbolic of the rising
and the setting of the sun. All were clad in rich
garments, fashioned according to their ages, and
their hair was arranged in representation of the
several stages of womanhood. They stood with
bowed head and extended foot, ready to reel and
swing at the first sound of the music.</p>

<p class="indent">At the centre of the crescent there sat facing the
dancers three others of a different type and a more
gaudy dress, with bright coloured ornaments in their
hair and much tinsel about their waists. These were
the koto players, who held their instruments in front
waiting the signal for them to begin the dance.</p>

<p class="indent">In front of these, facing the dancers, sat Michizane,
cross-toed and erect, with his withered hands folded
in front of him. He wore a plain grey kimono, which
folded under a long girdle, looped up at the side, and
his long white hair fluffed out and hung far down
over his stooped shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything was now silent, not even a leaf stirring.
The sun blazed in the west, and the deep shadows
told of its setting. The dancers grew animated, the
players composed, and Michizane reverent, and there
arose in the listeners mingled feelings of sorrow and
delight. Their hearts beat, and the grey poet bowed
low, and the dance began. The soft strains of music
inspired them, and the lesson unfolded before them
repeated the story of life for ever and evermore. One
by one the maidens laid bare their part in the great
drama that unfolds from the cradle to the grave, and
no man there looked without a deeper sense of responsibility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
and a happier inspiration for the day.
No vulgar thought disturbed them, for theirs was a
purer and a nobler reality. Base desires arose from
another source; the choosing, the sin. As the last
dancer disrobed the strains lowered, and when the
final shred was doffed the music ceased and the sun
set: the drama was over and the world in darkness.
There was no need for covering, no desire to live.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus those two passed the time, when it was
agreeable for them to meet. At Koyo-odori (maple
dance for girls) Takara gave a party on the lawn, to
which all of her younger girl friends in the neighbourhood
were invited. Tetsutaisho was there in
his uniform, with full regalia, and of course was the
idol of the fair young maidens, who looked upon him
as being little less than a god. In mid-winter the
Mukojima (snow-seeing trip) afforded an opportunity
to get into the country, where they lingered
and enjoyed themselves at will. The mountain
Tsukuba, just back of Tokyo, was their favourite
place for this event, whither the white-enrobed earth
stretched away to the ocean in front. Whether
winter or summer they were always happy when
together and lonely when not.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally on a bright morning in March&#151;it was
March third, the day of Hinanosaku, festival for
young girls&#151;the sun rose and cast its red among
the tall trees and the furrowed housetops of the
castle ground. Maido struck his pipe against the
brazier and then arose and slowly left his room.
Presently he climbed the short lacquered stairs and
entered a deserted room with panelled sash through
which the sunlight streamed and warmed the cheerless
place.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
The squared ceiling revealed a rich setting of wood
and grain, and the floor was spread over with soft,
clean matting. A large vase of beautiful blue, in
which grew a dwarfed orange, fragrant with bloom,
stood upon a raised recess in the wall. Over this
hung a long kakemono,[<a href="#index11">11</a><a name="fn11" id="fn11"></a>] done by an old master, and
in a corner stood a screen of rare embroidery. There
was nothing more, and the room seemed bare and
desolate. Takara was gone. The daimyo&#146;s heart
throbbed heavily, and he knelt behind the screen,
and with his face turned away begged Kimon to give
him freedom.</p>

<p class="indent">As he sat there an aged man, bent and sorrowful,
stole in and across the room to the sacred recess
in the wall, where he bowed, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Alas! It is well!&#148;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br/>
HOME ABANDONED</h2>

<p class="indent">Takara did not change, nor chafe, nor exalt
under the new conditions; she only loved
Tetsutaisho, and being installed in his house she felt
secure in what before hardly seemed a reality. His
heart was hers, she reasoned, and the law made his
domicile her privilege. And had he not convinced
her? And might not Nehachibana be proud of her
husband&#146;s choice? Better such a concubine than
an absent husband, she thought; and, after all, need
she rob her sister-in-law of what seemed impossible?</p>

<p class="indent">The lovers were happy, and Nehachibana, at first
flushed and nervous, had now grown cold and calm.
Her own chamber was comfortable, even luxurious,
yet for hours she would lay her ear close to the frail
partition, and a monster bade the fancies that leaped
to her brain. In her bath no abomination had
entered. No mugwort or sweet flag had desecrated
there. Yet the stork was as silent as the tombs of
Nodo, and her hopes had changed to fear, her position
to that of a slave. Once she crouched low and
listened; then she clutched at emptiness and her
face whitened, and she crawled back to her own
miserable mat and there planned and determined.
Presently she slept, and dreamed of her master&#146;s
expected son, which to her had been a blessing.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was she alone in her suspicions, for what she
had heard and dreamed the silvered poet visioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
and divined. The spirit had touched him, too, and
he sorrowed when he waked. Then as if moved by
an uncontrollable impulse he stole to Takara&#146;s abandoned
home and there mused at the unhallowed life
of his downfallen mistress, his idolised queen. Maido,
too, had gone there to reflect, and he made no move
to disturb the other, but left him to bide the impulse
of his nature, commune with the god of his disturbed
conscience. Michizane was the product of a nobler
life, the devotee of a gentler age, and a worshipper
at the tomb of an ancestry far removed from the
wicked intrigues of a feudal aristocracy. His was
of the mikado&#146;s way, the effect of a divine inspiration.
To transgress from its sacred guidance was
to fall from the pale of life and to forfeit every privilege
of redemption.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara, too, was born and bred of this master
influence, and notwithstanding her impulsive nature
possessed all the charm and dignity of a royal personage,
together with that broader intellect which
comes of high endeavour, and that better grace which
is the product of refined associations. She was proud
though not haughty, and in her soul there lived a
purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Unlike her, Nehachibana was the product of a
proud nobility. Shut up within the castle gates,
she had always been idolised and petted. She had
known of no want that was not supplied, and had
expressed not a wish that was not gratified; every
luxury had been showered upon her. Her sense of
the good was the one bright hope in her life, for she
knew not the force of intellect, nor had she been
taught to reason. When she went forth into the
world she was helpless in the race, and when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
tasted of the bitter it was like the gall of quassia,
and she fell at the shrine of Amida.</p>

<p class="indent">Of a sweet disposition, Nehachibana had always
looked upon the brighter side of life; therefore it
was the more difficult for her to reconcile herself
to the thought that hers was not a just treatment.
She sometimes felt that it was her own shortcomings
that had driven her husband away from her, and then
she would set about with renewed effort to see that
his house was made agreeable to his coming, and her
love worthy of his taking. Once she said to herself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I shall please him. He is mine and I must win.
No other loves him as I do; none but me can have
him. He is mine unto death. I shall&#151;but oh!
that other one! And the law, and I&#151;O Kami, my
heart, my heart, it is breaking! Is there no help?
Is there no help for&#151;me? But she, she has his
love! It is not he, it is his weakness that she loves!
And I, I am helpless!&#151;Helpless? No! Did I not
hear Kiyokime, the goddess of hate? And did she
not say revenge? And I a woman? Then to the
work, and let it be as swift as the necessities may
allow. I will have revenge!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">However, it was less easy for Nehachibana to execute
than to resolve. She was now entirely cut off
from any association whatever with her rival, and
found it difficult even to satisfy her curiosity. This
unpleasant situation had been brought about more
by the foolishness of her mother-in-law than by her
own dulness, yet it affected her none the less for that.
Heretofore it had been irksome to do service for her
rival, which both situation and custom compelled,
but now that she had resolved it would have been a
pleasure. Still, as difficulties arose her determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
increased, and she not only concluded to bide
her time but to make certain her victory.</p>

<p class="indent">When Takara came into their home Tetsutaisho&#146;s
mother was at first so overwhelmed with the honour
and so proud of herself that she became not only
tyrannical to her former household but somewhat
insufferable to the newcomer. The new acquisition
had insisted upon bringing all of her own servants,
and had little need and less desire for the assistance
of her gallant&#146;s mother or other relations: that was
something she had not bargained for, and she was
of a mind not to tolerate meddlesome interference.
Consequently, Takara had not been there many
months before she had appropriated to her own
exclusive use that portion of the premises which
suited her most.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho personally concerned himself in these
sometimes threatening matters no further than to
give his consent to anything that anybody might
propose; and as his mother took the ground that
it was her right, and as Nehachibana had nothing
to ask, the proposals were always on the side of
Takara and the victory in her favour. While Tetsutaisho
did not mean to be irreverent he did love
a plucky battle and was inclined to the belief that to
the winner belongs the spoils. That, probably as
much as a careless indifference, prompted him to give
the ladies of the house a free hand in its management,
and always to absent himself at the first sign of a
disturbance.</p>

<p class="indent">It was, possibly, at one of these bothersome times
that Tetsutaisho stole out and unconsciously found
his way to the council chamber. He had gone away
in this manner before, but seldom got so far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
hall of state. Sometimes he loafed at headquarters
or called upon Maido. More often he spent the
hour with Ikamon, who was now deeply engrossed
with adjusting local affairs so as to meet the requirements
of foreign interference, but on this occasion
a higher purpose seemed to control him, and for the
first time he voiced his sentiment in unmistakable
terms.</p>

<p class="indent">Unconsciously, perhaps, but none the less certain,
the hated stranger had peeped into the treasure box,
and so infused a commercial and diplomatic awakening
as to lay the foundation for nothing less than
the rehabilitation of a long lost empire. It was the
dawn of a new era, and no one more than Ikamon
interpreted correctly the scope and consequence of
so sudden a contact with Christian civilization. As
yet the shogunate had not been openly accused of
collusion with the foreigners; still whisperings to that
effect had been heard, as coming from Kyoto; and
the prime minister, no more to be outdone at home
than to be defeated from abroad, began to encourage
an increase in the army and to advise Tetsutaisho
accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon was, also, not slow to grasp at the importance
of improved methods and had strongly urged
Tetsutaisho to bestir himself in adopting and applying
more effective instruments, but the latter was
rather inclined to the belief that there was not so
much to be gained by radical changes: that the disorganisation
attendant upon the introduction of
new measures more than offset the benefits derived.
He reasoned that the samurai were already trained
and fully equipped. He knew they were brave to
a man, and loyal.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
&#147;What more,&#148; said he, &#147;would you have? Would
you see cowardice supplant courage, and the black
powder of a foe substituted for the ringing steel of
our forefathers? These men are invincible, and
Tetsutaisho is a general. Give me the opportunity,
the occasion, and I will convince you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke his voice rang with the pride of ages,
and the council halls echoed and re-echoed with
applause. Even Ikamon was for the moment swept
away with enthusiasm, as the vigorous man swung
his great arms and shouted the glory of the nation&#146;s
defenders. It was not so much a want of understanding
that made Tetsutaisho slow to feel the necessity
of change, but it was more the red blood coursing
through his veins which gave him an unbounded
faith in the loyal, faithful, worshipping army at his
command. He believed in their superiority and felt
them worthy of their country&#146;s confidence, and as
he retired from the chamber and walked out into
the park his step livened with pride and his whole
being quickened with a rising confidence in himself
and a growing contentment with the world. He
thought of his home and of the love that Takara had
lain at his feet; of the faithful, patient consideration
of Nehachibana, his lawful wife and worthy helpmeet;
of his mother, and how she fretted and worried
and fussed as opportunities came and her station
advanced; then suddenly he came upon Kinsan and
all this vanished from his memory as if a thing of
yesterday.</p>

<p class="indent">She was with her father, who stood off some distance
turning a tiny stream of water into the garden,
which showed the ravages of a long dry spell. It was
Choyo, the ninth day of the ninth month, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
had been no rain for more than a moon past. Kinsan
sat in the shade of a spreading oak, at one corner of
the garden near where the roadway passed, and
grouped about her were a number of children whose
wide eyes sparkled with interest as she repeated to
them a poem well suited to the occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a favourite selection from Onokomachi, the
blind poetess, who ever prayed for rain. The words
were familiar to Tetsutaisho and he, too, stopped at
the border and listened. Kinsan&#146;s voice rang tender
and sweet, though there seemed a pathos which
touched him and caused a deeper interest. Had he
neglected her? Was she now pleading for that which
he had so long sought? His memory went out to
her, and he determined again to try.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br/>
A GREAT SORROW</h2>

<p class="indent">Soon Kinsan&#146;s father was attracted by the new
melody of her voice, and he, too, came and stood
near and listened. No word was said until after the
song had been finished. Then Fujimoto came forward
and bowed to Tetsutaisho. This was the first
warning Kinsan had of the unusual audience her
singing had attracted, and she quickly arose and
bowed and made excuses for her inattention.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I would rather you sat there and sang than to
have arisen and courtesied a thousand times,&#148; said
Tetsutaisho, as he left the roadside and made his
way among the lilacs to where she was standing.
&#147;One does not often have the opportunity, though
the wish be constant, and the privilege of being one
of such an audience!&#148; he continued, as he leaned
over and caressed first one and then another of the
little children as they came huddling up. &#147;Were
it not that you deserve such happiness, Fujimoto, I
might almost envy you your good fortune in being
placed here amidst such loveliness. The trees, the
birds, the flowers, the children&#151;and, allow me,
the daughter&#151;among whom you dwell, must certainly
inspire a rare happiness.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The children had by this time scampered in all
directions, and the three elders were left to speak
or go as they liked.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, honourable sir.&#148; said Fujimoto, touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
not a little, &#147;these are truly things not to be despised.
The daughter is my comfort: all are my joy,
and after all, my lot may not be a despicable one.
Had I always the favour of Sumi, god of water, my
task might be lighter. Still I am content, and happy
so long as my Kinsan is spared to me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing further was said about Kinsan; the one
and only object of interest which the nobleman
could have or cared to have in the humble gardener&#146;s
affairs. They walked along at Tetsutaisho&#146;s suggestion
toward the cottage, which stood some little
distance farther on. When the big officer entered
the palace enclosure he had no intention of making
the gardener&#146;s family a call. In fact, he had of late
almost dismissed them from his mind; but the moment
he heard Kinsan&#146;s voice the spark within again came
to life, and when he drew near and saw how modestly
she sat and how neatly she was gowned and how her
eyes sparkled with life and how the blood rose to
her cheeks, his heart flamed more fiercely than before.
Tetsutaisho pondered, then said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is only the father who stands in my way. If
I could but get his confidence, I might then win her
love. But why ask anybody&#146;s consent? Force will
get me the one thing, and&#151;well, persistence the
other. They are both at my disposal&#151;why delay
the matter?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan did not speak as they walked, but fell
into a deep study. Whether it came to her intuitively
or from a change in Tetsutaisho&#146;s mood she
partially understood him, and as they approached
the house and she thought of her mother a feeling
of fear took hold of her and she trembled and hesitated.
She knew of their straitened circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
and of how her mother had repeatedly chided
her father for not having taken advantage of Tetsutaisho&#146;s
former liberal offer. The ends of her fingers
tingled, then grew cold, and the perspiration stood
in great beads on her forehead. When they had
arrived at the house and her mother came running
out, bowing to the visitor, Kinsan&#146;s heart sickened,
and she no longer possessed that confidence in her
father which had hitherto buoyed her under each
successive trial.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is the hand of fate, and I am its certain victim,&#148;
was the thought which ran through her mind and
would not go away.</p>

<p class="indent">When the rest entered the house she politely withdrew,
unnoticed, and went away, far into the woods,
and on and on until she came to the hidden cave,
where every rock and all the flowers and even the
stars had sung again and again of her great love and
Shibusawa&#146;s faith. She did not return, but lingered
and stayed, and prayed fresh prayers; and then she
thought she saw him there bending over her; she
heard him speak and looked into his eyes, and felt
again the power of his love. After a long time she
went away, and when far from the cave and all about
was darkness and she was uncertain of her way a chill
came over her and she thought of the tempter&#146;s bait
and her mother&#146;s weakness.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would to God that I, too, had found a way!&#148;
was her last thought as she nestled upon her wooden
pillow, and at last slept a broken, restless sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Late that evening Tetsutaisho left the cottage
and lightly tripped along down the pathway toward
his own house. As he went his steps quickened,
and he almost ran with delight. He carried in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
girdle a document which on the morrow he would
safely file and thus insure the proper keeping of its
lawful provisions. Upon his arrival he hurriedly
entered the house, and that night Takara may have
had, for the first time, misgivings of a weaker purpose
on Tetsutaisho&#146;s part than she herself had divined.</p>

<p class="indent">However that may have been, it mattered not to
Tetsutaisho, for on the following day his own carriers
set in front of the gardener&#146;s cottage a beautiful
lacquered chair into which there stepped a weeping,
sorrowing child; a daughter whose only price was
the worth of her virtue, whose only hope lay in the
power of her own frail hands.</p>

<p class="indent">She went, and with her the rags that hung upon
her back. There was not a mother&#146;s blessing, and
the father had slunk back from witnessing the fruit
of a heartless wife&#146;s bargaining. It was not the first.
Others had likewise served. And the fathers and
mothers had for ages eagerly and unknowingly partaken
of the wages.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br/>
THE CHILD</h2>

<p class="indent">Upon Kinsan&#146;s arrival at Tetsutaisho&#146;s house
she was treated with every consideration by
her master, and in reality though not in fact given
equal rank with the mistress. She was settled in
that part of the house over which his mother was
supposed to reign and his lawful wife, Nehachibana,
had been the principal personage, and while not
raised to the place of a concubine she was given all
the privileges of one. Her position was supposed
to be that of a servant, yet in turn she was given
servants and no duties were, by Tetsutaisho, exacted
of her. It was not because he did not intend her to
be his full-fledged concubine, nor because he had any
scruples about Nehachibana that he did not give
Kinsan that position; but simply because he entertained
grave doubts about Takara&#146;s pleasure in the
matter&#151;something with which even he as yet hesitated
to trifle.</p>

<p class="indent">He had gained Takara&#146;s love, and her honest love,
upon the strength of an affinity&#151;a thing which, so
long as it lasted, brooked no rival. He had,
though, in taking her into his house assumed responsibilities
far beyond personal ones; and recognising
the superiority of her position realised that, should
he incur her displeasure, she had but to call upon a
power that might overthrow and discard him in
spite of his usefulness. He sought, therefore, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
deceive Takara as to his real purpose in bringing
Kinsan into the house, and to let her discover by
slow degrees that, without a proper encouragement,
even affinity may wane and finally cease to hold the
object of its affection.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara still loved him and was none the wiser;
thus he continued without danger his complicated
relations, though she felt a growing coldness and the
oncoming of something, she knew not what. She
was now deeply worried and much given to thinking,
for there was approaching also a critical period; but
when rumours came to her ears, and she chided him
about Kinsan, he answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Takara, you do me a great injustice. I am not
only true, as you see, but I have anticipated the necessity
of keeping at hand one upon whose shoulders
may be placed the responsibilities for the care of our
child.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But why not intrust that service to one whom
we know to be best fitted?&#148; asked Takara, anxiously.
&#147;There is Nannoto, whose mother carried in her arms
your mother&#146;s mother.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, Takara; it is not the service I would trouble
myself about. My lady should not so degrade herself.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why degraded? You told me not.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is not the fashion.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But if it is my choice?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have no choice.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you take from a mother her child?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The law allows it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then the law is unjust, and there is a better way.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Fashion is inexorable, and the law must be
upheld.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
&#147;Whether the fashion or the law, it is wrong. A
mother&#146;s breast is a woman&#146;s joy.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Obedience is a woman&#146;s highest virtue.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Takara understood fully the force as well as the
law of her chosen lord&#146;s argument, though she was
none the less aware of her own recourse. While she
felt the chagrin of defeat she realised the danger of
appeal; therefore she concluded to bide her time and
make the best use of her opportunities. Her love
for him was not dead, but there was awakening
within her a new light, a better purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana, though better informed, had been
the more easily deceived. Not that she in the least
misunderstood her husband&#146;s motive in foisting upon
her another and a still more unwelcome rival, but
that she entirely mistook Kinsan&#146;s position. Nehachibana
loved Tetsutaisho&#151;just why she had never
stopped to inquire. If it was because she was his
wife, her love was none the less intense; and because
she was in love with him, she thought every other
woman must be&#151;at least all those who evinced the
slightest interest, whether courted or courting. And
if she was to share another portion, she found much
consolation if not happiness in the thought that
Takara, too, must lose in like proportion. It was a
reiteration of the old adage that there can be no great
loss without some small gain; a jealous reward and
a revengeful satisfaction. She now pitied Takara
and hated Kinsan (in virtue of a community of feeling)&#151;the
one because of her position, the other in
consequence of hers.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother&#146;s indifference proved to be as great a
blessing to Kinsan as it was a curse to Nehachibana.
What the one gained by being let alone the other lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
in virtue of being served likewise, thus results struck
a happy balance. But it was from another source
that fear and anxiety came to both alike, to Nehachibana
because of neglect and to Kinsan because of
danger.</p>

<p class="indent">As the last sight of the latter&#146;s childhood home had
vanished from her view she bent down under the
weight of her grief, but when she had arrived at
Tetsutaisho&#146;s place of sin and had been brought face
to face with his mock glances she fell upon her knees,
not in humble supplication, but in the full recognition
of her weakness. It was then that she prayed
as only one can pray who values life less than honour;
and when the fiendish touch came she did not yield,
but shrank from him and spoke her mind in a voice
that is beyond the power of words. Sheer courage
lost him his victim, determination saved her.</p>

<p class="indent">Stunned by the force of her great purity, he did
not lessen his persistence, but delayed from time to
time a more cowardly intention; finally there dawned
within him the impulse of a purer love, which gradually
overcame his weakness and made it possible to
find a better way. He decided now to hold her in
reality as a servant, and on the seventh day after
the birth of the child, himself took it, and carrying
it to Kinsan, placed it in her arms and told her that
it should be her charge. It was a fine, large boy,
the eyes and mould revealing its mother&#146;s heritage,
and as Tetsutaisho gave Kinsan the baby, he bade
her call it Sodachinojoi, and say nothing more. Then
he said to her:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have refused me; now you must serve mine.
So long as you do that, and do it well, and as I bid,
you shall know no penalty, though it is a grave sin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
to oppose your master&#146;s will. And when you have
done, I shall trust to gratitude for what you have so
persistently withheld. Go now, and beware of the
inquisitive.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My heart bids me do my part,&#148; said she, in answer.
&#147;This burden is even more, it is a blessing. I pray
for strength that I may serve well and please much.
The reward is already mine.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you would mock me, heigh? Bring me the
child&#151;no; I shall send you both to the dungeon,&#148;
and he arose and stood meditating.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I pray you, sir, send me, but save the child. It is
innocent, and it has a mother. I am unworthy, yet
I will pay the penalty. Pray, sir?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not answer at once, but stood regarding
her; he may have marvelled at her charity, possibly
he was touched by her tenderness. At all events he
moved closer, and whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Kinsan, I truly love you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not hear him. Her eyes rested on the
child in her arms. She was thinking of a mother&#146;s
sorrow, possibly a child&#146;s fate. He came close up
and would have touched her had she not shrunk from
him and cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I do not comprehend. It is not his voice. It
is not true.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Aha,&#148; said Tetsutaisho to himself, as he leaned
back in silence. &#147;It is not I that she disdains, but
it is another whom she loves.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then after a while he addressed her saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Kinsan, I trust you will pardon my incivility.
I did not mean to be rude, though I may deserve
your censure. And now that it is done, I do not
want you to feel that it is my heart that is wrong.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
Do me the honour to serve this child, and Tetsutaisho
shall see to it that the reward be as you desire. I
leave you free to say as much, if it is your pleasure.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The honour is mine to serve. The pleasure,
yours to grant. And is there any higher?&#148; asked
she, confident and earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho soon after withdrew and left Kinsan
to begin her new duties with a lighter heart and a
better confidence. She felt with renewed hope that
there was still a chance for the right. And now that
her hands were no longer idle, she must drive away
despair and set about with fresh courage to make
much happiness out of the little that life offered.</p>

<p class="indent">She soon learned to love the child, and often took
it from the nurse and held it in her own arms. At
dusk of night she would sit for hours, singing lullabies
or reciting favourite poems. Sometimes she peered
dreamily, softly, into the far distance, and then her
voice would rise to the sweet, lonely pitch of the
nightingale or deepen into tenderest pathos. Once
these sad, weird strains reached Tetsutaisho&#146;s ears,
and they touched him more deeply, strangely, than
when he first heard her at the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is her soul speaking its wonderful love,&#148; said
he to himself, as he lounged and listened from his
own mat on a dark, still night, &#147;and I would give all
that is in this world were that love for me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he asked Ikamon to come to his house and
listen in the cool of the evening to her songs and her
poems. No mention was made to her of her intended
audience, for Tetsutaisho had learned her true spirit
and was now beginning to respect her. He would
not so intrude as to ask her to sing; her heart only
alone and undisturbed could invoke such melody;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
yet he could not resist inviting his friend to share
the pleasure of her voice, though only by chance
might they be so privileged. Ikamon came and he,
too, was charmed.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is the grandest voice I ever heard,&#148; said he,
with enthusiasm, as he arose and thanked his host for
the entertainment, preparatory to taking his leave.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>
THE VOW OF VENGEANCE</h2>

<p class="indent">When Ikamon had gone Tetsutaisho retired,
and as he did so he went with the satisfaction
of having discovered, as he thought, the secret of his
failure. He had always regarded Kinsan as a prize
not to be overlooked, but had not offered to divine
her real charm. His repeated defeat had not been
attributed to that; it was upon baser grounds he had
excused himself and accused her. Her constancy,
however, had awakened in him a better sense of her
nature, and he now began to feel the force of her
virtue; but having again mistaken her, and wrongfully
attributed her refusal to the success of a rival, he
became mad and vowed vengeance as well as victory.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will hunt him down!&#148; said he to himself, as he
entered his den, and there stayed and fretted, in
spite of Takara&#146;s repeated urgent calls. &#147;It is not
Kinsan, but her lover that is the real cause of my
discomfiture. Law makes right, and Tetsutaisho
shall vindicate the law.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He retired late, but felt himself rewarded by the
day&#146;s ending. At first he had really intended to give
Kinsan only the care of the child, but now it occurred
to him to make it her own. The power was in his
hands; why not use it? She seemed glad of the care,
and it would give her an occupation, an excuse for
being in his house: her lover would divine another
reason.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
Takara ought not to suffer much from the loss, and
should profit by the subterfuge. Her birth, her position,
her ambition, all demanded a better protection,
a surer disposition. Why not benefit her? There
was not a soul in the house who might be any the
wiser, unless it were Michizane, the poet, and banishment
must silence him. That were a simple matter
and Ikamon would attend to it at once. His own
devotion to Takara for a short time should quell any
misgivings and allay all feelings on her part, while
a little deception would start everything smoothly
on its proper course.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am the man!&#148; thought he, and he slumbered
long and in peace.</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning he hurried to Takara, and when
he had left her she was thankful for his having come,
and less doubtful about his sincerity. Whether real
or not, she realised that the wiser course is to turn
a bad bargain to good use, and resigned herself to
the hope, if not belief, that his plans were for the best
and that he would keep his promises.</p>

<p class="indent">Before leaving the house for the day Tetsutaisho
ran in to see the child and incidentally make some
assurances to Kinsan. She, glad of the opportunity,
resigned herself to her task without questioning too
closely the purpose or thinking much about the outcome.
Here at least was a respite, and anything
promising to stay the hand of fate was to her indeed
welcome. Therefore, when Nehachibana came in
later in the day and found Kinsan cooing over a
little red baby, all flounced with silk, a-kicking and
a-crying, her face coloured and she began to question
its kindly mistress with something of curiosity, if
not suspicion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
&#147;Oh, what a pretty baby!&#148; said she, as she crossed
the room and squatted on the floor in front. &#147;And
where did you get it? It is so cunning. Is it yours?
I wish I had a baby like that&#151;so big and bright.
But then it wouldn&#146;t have eyes like those, I know.
Would it? Let me see your eyes, Kinsan&#151;I never
could tell a baby&#146;s mother.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I shall not let you have this one, though you
don&#146;t see its mother in its eyes. It&#146;s a good baby,
and its name is Sodachinojoi, and no more.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, what a name! and how? My husband said
you are a gardener&#146;s daughter.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And even so, the breeding may be none the less.
I hope you will like the baby, and I will do all I can
to make him worthy of his name and a joy to us all.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Why do you not say, &#145;My baby&#146;? I should, if
I had one.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then why don&#146;t you?&#148; said Kinsan, with much
surprise; she still believing that only Nehachibana
could be the mother of her husband&#146;s child, as her own
mother had been of all her father&#146;s children.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Take your charge, you impudent thing! I shall
never set foot upon your mat again. No, never!&#148;
shrieked Nehachibana, as she pushed the child toward
Kinsan and flew from the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan was not greatly disturbed by Nehachibana&#146;s
demeanour, though the thrust was painful and entirely
uncalled for so far as she could see or know.
However, she was by this time accustomed to jeers,
if not insults, and did not take the words much to
heart, and only thought of how agreeable it would
be should the other make good her threat and stay
away; at least until such time as her understanding
prompted a kinder treatment.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br/>
THE POET&#146;S BANISHMENT</h2>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana in a measure made good her
threat, and as Tetsutaisho&#146;s mother was devoted
more to her own interests than to doubtful
infants, and had always regarded Kinsan with suspicion,
she, too, took particular pains to keep well
out of the way. Tetsutaisho soon came to spending
much of his time at army headquarters, at Ikamon&#146;s,
or at the council chamber. Takara&#146;s sorrow for the
loss of her child, which she had not been permitted to
see since it was taken away from her, though in some
degree mitigated&#151;satisfactorily to everybody except
Nehachibana&#151;by Tetsutaisho&#146;s devotion, during
the little time he now spent at home, occupied her
attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus affairs at home adjusted themselves, while
at state the lordly general busied himself principally
with getting Ikamon to scheme the banishment and
deportation of the pious, harmless old poet and faithful
servant, Michizane. The prime minister was
finally induced to urge so severe a measure, more
through his efforts to hush up every possible chance
for a clash between the two rival factions over
Takara&#146;s strange and painful situation, than as a
personal favour to his friend. The venerable sage
had been her only confidant, as well as a possible
adviser to the enemy; therefore Tetsutaisho not only
desired to get rid of him, but Ikamon deemed it
expedient to do so.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
Nor had they long to wait the opportunity, for
there was at that time some question as to whether
in case of death there was a lawful successor to the
shogun. While the matter was as yet of no real importance
either to the shogunate or the party, it was
seized upon and agitated by Ikamon for a double
purpose. Had there been any real prospects of
Iyesada&#146;s losing hold on life there might have been
occasion for the great ado which was being made
about it; for the shogun to die without a lawful successor
was considered the greatest misfortune that
could befall the nation. The proper degree of interest
having been aroused, and the shogun himself
having taken on the desired state of susceptibility,
it was urged upon his highness to call in the customary
wise man without delay; and as Michizane had
already become known for his premonitions, Ikamon
had only to mention the poet&#146;s name to induce his
selection.</p>

<p class="indent">Michizane was sitting at his accustomed place
musing the hours away when a messenger, escorted
by two courtiers with large letters emblazoned upon
their uniforms, approached and with much ceremony
handed him a parchment roll. It was the shogun&#146;s
command, so Michizane trembled as he broke the
seal and read from the long document, which unrolled
from his hand. It was a great honour conferred,
even more than he had dared ever to dream, and
charity should pardon the rise of feeling which he
then experienced.</p>

<p class="indent">A chair stood outside awaiting his pleasure, and
also a regular cavalcade of guards, runners, carriers,
and attendants was there, in silk and gold, ready to
pay him attention. At first he said not a word;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
then glancing around and bowing low, signalled his
&#147;honourable informant&#148; to await his &#147;miserable
preparation.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">After advising his mistress, and receiving her
blessing&#151;amid somewhat of misgivings&#151;he
marched down the line and took his place in the
swaying palanquin. Without delay he was carried
directly to the hall of state, where Ikamon met him
and, escorting him to a private chamber held and
coached him until the hour of his presentation had
arrived. And while there, the very first thing impressed
upon his mind was his indebtedness to Ikamon
and to no other for the honour of his appointment.
He needed no coaching as to the gravity of the
situation; that was a thing to be understood.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are to tell the shogun, the supreme administrator
of the divine mikado, the confidant of Ikamon,
and the lover of his loyal subjects, that there
is extreme danger of a failure of succession should
his august highness refuse longer to sojourn without
the pale of his reverend predecessors, and that it
now becomes your painful duty to predict the immediate
adoption of one Iyemochi, a member of the
legion, and supporter of the cause.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">This is what Ikamon told the innocent Michizane
to say, yet he knew it would so enrage the shogun
that he would cause the seer forthwith to be consigned
to harakiri or banishment for life. Ikamon
had also anticipated its other effect upon the doubtful
Iyesada, causing him to brood over the succession
and finally to carry out the predicted measure in
the hope of warding off an evil hand. The banishment
of the poet would be a welcome thing because
it was pleasing to his friend and war god, Tetsutaisho.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
The adoption of Iyemochi, a willing tool,
would insure Ikamon&#146;s complete domination of the
shogunate upon Iyesada&#146;s death, which he thought
might be hastened if not occasioned.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Ikamon planned and the proud, puffed-up
scholar obeyed; and before the day had passed Michizane
found his vanity gratified and himself condemned
to banishment for the rest of his life. When
night came he was lashed down with cords, and
without a parting word carried far away, never to
return.</p>

<p class="indent">The oracle had spoken and the bigoted, suspicious
Iyesada had believed it the voice of Ema-O, and
knowing of no safer commitment chose the Isle of
Banishment. Nor did this alone satisfy his overwrought
conscience, but immediately the thing was
done he called Ikamon and upon his advice adopted
forthwith the child successor, and proclaimed a universal
rejoicing.</p>

<p class="indent">The new heir was hailed with acclamation, Ikamon
praised for his cleverness, and Tetsutaisho applauded
by his admiring friends; though new troubles dawned
on every side. Takara&#146;s eyes opened to her true situation,
and her faithful adherents rallied to plan her
deliverance. Tetsutaisho observed her growing indifference,
but crediting it with no deeper meaning
than personal apathy sought in his old way to revive
the spark which so soon seemed all but dead. It was
of no use, for Takara saw farther than he knew.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br/>
THE FORTY-SEVEN RONIN</h2>

<p class="indent">Takara deeply mourned the fate of Michizane,
whom she not only loved but had revered as
the only living representative left to her of a fast
fading memory. She pondered, but wisely held her
counsel. Tetsutaisho did not fathom her, but satisfied
himself and reviled her upon shallower grounds.</p>

<p class="indent">When left to his own recourse, shorn of impulse,
his understanding seldom rose above the lesser order.
He was big in war, but small in consequence. Nor
was his sympathy any the greater, and when she
remonstrated about her child, he laughed and told
her that she, a daughter of royalty, should be the
last to question the wisdom of the law. He only
urged her to forget the circumstance and respect his
will. She acquiesced for the time being, but there
was rising within her a bitter spirit. There was
coming a day when the mind, too, should assert its
rank; when the soul should attain its fulness.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But why are you less ardent?&#148; questioned he,
one evening after having returned from Kinsan&#146;s
apartments, where, as Takara knew, he was now in
the habit of regularly spending much time.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you ask me why darkness follows
light, the earth rotates on its axis, and flesh turns
to stone? I thought you a man of consequence,
not an object of pity,&#148; answered she, calmly though
earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Tetsutaisho stood aghast at her daring, yet thought
not to search for its meaning. Had he but looked
outside, the veil might have fallen from his blinded
eyes, for the same spirit which moved Takara had
roused a host of valiant defenders. The boldness of
Ikamon&#146;s stroke had so stunned the enemy as to
irrevocably establish the new order, but not without
inevitably disastrous consequences.</p>

<p class="indent">Even to the shogun&#146;s supporters, the destruction
of the apparently harmless Michizane, and the advent
of the scarcely known child, Iyeyoshi, seemed so
veiled in mystery that many were inclined to believe
that some deep-laid scheme lay behind a rather elusive
but possible trick. In consequence, the shogun,
in his weakness, anxious to hide his stupidity behind
some apparent justification, took the burden upon
his own shoulders and thus widened the breach between
himself and his true friends, increasing to that
extent his dependence upon Ikamon.</p>

<p class="indent">The discontent due to the adoption of an heir to
the shogunate became after a time, however, somewhat
allayed; but the curiosity aroused by the banishment
of Michizane increased, and the feeling of unrest
at the mikado&#146;s seat grew to such degree that before
a year had passed the south began to assume a resentful
if not hostile attitude. Nearly five years
had elapsed since their favourite daughter, Takara,
had been carried away to become the wife of Shibusawa,
the most promising of the young princes under
the shogunate. No results had as yet obtained
from this alliance, nor had the restoration of the
kuge[<a href="#index12">12</a><a name="fn12" id="fn12"></a>] taken place as promised. They were dissatisfied,
and Takara&#146;s misalliance was the first pretext
seized upon to rouse a determined move. Spies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
had been sent to Tokyo and the whole truth discovered
to a few of the leaders, yet from policy&#146;s sake
these reports had been suppressed in the hope of perfecting
a more judicious organisation before the advent
of a general uprising.</p>

<p class="indent">This conservatism on the part of the southern
leaders baffled Ikamon, who believed them, like himself,
incapable of looking beyond self-interest for
a motive. Others might sacrifice and strive for
humanity, but the sweet-voiced god Oshaka ever
whispered in Ikamon&#146;s ear the one word, &#147;Self.&#148; It
was self that lay at the bottom; self that raised
the human above the brute; self that promised life
eternal: the gods were but self, asserted and ordained,
and ordinary man was only the blind, the halt, the
sympathetic. Diplomacy was his weapon, heroism
an humbler man&#146;s part.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho was now too much absorbed with
personal affairs even to try to grasp the outer shreds
of a complicated political situation. True, he had
realised in some measure from time to time that an
ugly gossip circulated on the outside as to affairs
at his house; yet he was slow to appreciate its importance,
and but for being urged from other sources
would have given it barely passing notice. He busied
himself more with shifting his attentions from a
worn love to one that was new though elusive, and
as yet unfound.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Tetsutaisho for once released Takara from
his constant attention, and when she lay down in
the freedom of her chamber she marvelled at his
neglect, for she not only knew his real purpose in
bringing Kinsan into the house, but understood his
utter failure. She realised that the innocent girl&#146;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
struggles had not been in vain, and she gloried in her
virtue. She said to herself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What a womanhood! Oh, if I had but known
the way! How gladly would I surrender the wreath
of state, the power of kings, for the crown of purity!
But alas! it is not mine. It is only for those who
know their true god. May I never again see
mine!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she slept, and she dreamed that she heard
Michizane&#146;s voice, that he spoke to her, and that
the words were a poem in praise of her ancestors,
that all about was a garden and in it were her friends;
that her soul turned to beauty, and joy came down
from Heaven, and all was peace. She did not wake,
but saw Hyaku, the young magician, and felt the
power of his magic, although she could neither move
nor speak.</p>

<p class="indent">The Band of Forty-Seven had entered Takara&#146;s
chamber at dead of night, and placing her in a light
chair slung upon the backs of swift carriers, well disguised,
ran with the speed of the hare, the endurance
of the ox; and before they could be overtaken, or
it was really known what had happened, they were
at Kyoto, in her own mother&#146;s house; when again
Takara saw the hand of Hyaku, and felt its power;
she awakened and there was real gladness in her
heart. She made no inquiry as to how it all happened,
or as to the motive which prompted their
timely action. She knew that it was the ronin[<a href="#index13">13</a><a name="fn13" id="fn13"></a>]
who fetched her, and that she was welcome when she
got there. Had she known all, she would have understood
better how those trusted men had for days and
months waited and watched their chance to seize
and carry her away to her friends; back to the home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
she had surrendered to no purpose except that of
sorrow and regret.</p>

<p class="indent">The news of Takara&#146;s return to the home of her
childhood, and of the manner of her escape, soon
became known to the immediate friends of Tetsutaisho&#146;s
family. Maido paid but little attention to
the circumstance, and thus, probably, gave occasion
for the rumour, which gained some credence,
that he had actually winked at her going and was not
particular about her returning. However that may
be, his general failing and prolonged worry over
Shibusawa&#146;s absence were not a sufficient shield for
his indifference, at least in the opinion of some of
his less intimate friends. Tetsutaisho, more dazed
at the audacity of the ronin than puzzled with the
reason for Takara&#146;s abduction, at first inclined toward
instituting a vigorous pursuit, but upon second
thought concluded he had best consult his friends
before inaugurating any such serious undertaking.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is not so much that I care for the concubine,&#148;
said he to Ikamon, on the following day; &#147;it is the
vindication of the law that prompts me to send a
detachment for her relief. These bands of marauders
must be suppressed, even at the cost of war upon
their stronghold. What safety is there for a gentleman
so long as his castle may be entered and his
property carried away while he sleeps? The next
we hear, it will be the shogun himself of whom we
are robbed. Give Tetsutaisho the word, I say, and
he will soon make an end of it&#151;Saigo, the ronin, his
dreamers, Kido, and all.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon did not fire so easily as to let his enthusiasm
run away with his judgment, yet he was none
the less quick to apprehend the danger confronting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
them. The paltry sop thrown to Saigo and a few
followers had scarcely touched the lofty progress of
the literati. There could be but one finale: materialism
must sooner or later find itself pitted against
patriotism. Iyesada, weak and uncertain, was little
to the purpose in a serious conflict, and no one knew
better than Ikamon the over-sensitive shogun&#146;s inclination
to side with the last to persuade; of his want
of policy; of his anxiety and bewilderment. He
therefore urged upon Tetsutaisho the necessity of
proceeding in the dark and cautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Keep these fellows at bay,&#148; said he, confidentially,
&#147;until we can discover their real purpose and
strength. In the meantime Iyesada may die&#151;Ikamon
can then safely devise. The shogunate in the
hands of an infant is better to our purpose. The
plans of the mikadate if in our hands can be made
to serve rather than defeat us. I would advise, if
advice be meet, that you send out your spies and keep
at home your force.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho heeded the warning, and before long
copious if not trustworthy news came from every
conceivable source. Iyesada soon died, and the
youthful Iyemochi succeeded as shogun; while Tetsutaisho
marvelled at Ikamon&#146;s wisdom, and more
than ever resigned himself to the conquest of more
peaceful delights. Kinsan had suddenly become the
sole object of his attention, and for her heart he
pressed his suit, more than ever ardent, if not sincere.
Maido, absolved from all these matters, had more
and more devoted himself to the memory of his
son, but now that good news had reached him
he rejoiced, and anxiously awaited the return of
Shibusawa.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br/>
THE HOME-COMING</h2>

<p class="indent">Maido had not long to wait, though the time
seemed never to pass. It was the first word
received from his son, for Shibusawa knew the danger
of even attempting to communicate with either his
parent or Kinsan. During all these years he knew
not what effect his departure had wrought at home,
nor of the fortunes of those whom he had left behind.
Still he had always hoped for the best, and when he
had definitely made up his mind to return he so managed
to forward the letter of advice as to bring it
safely to Maido&#146;s hand; arriving, as it happened,
only a few days after Takara had been seized and
carried away by the ronin, and none too early, for
Shibusawa himself came soon thereafter.</p>

<p class="indent">To avoid possible compromise Shibusawa had
couched the letter in such terms that no one but a
father could be the wiser for its contents; therefore
no dates were fixed, and the anxious daimyo had only
to wait, and for hours sat watching the gate in front.
These were suspicious times at Tokyo, hence no
preparations could be made for the home-coming,
nor information given out, save Maido&#146;s instructions
to the faithful Okyo. Thereafter no arrival escaped
that one&#146;s vigilant eye, and when the expected ship
had safely arrived at Yokohama he was there on
hand with an extra pilgrim&#146;s outfit on his back.</p>

<p class="indent">Late the next evening they two reached home, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
Shibusawa, footsore and weary, hurried up the pathway
and into the house, where he bowed low at his
father&#146;s feet. Neither attempted to speak. When
Shibusawa had changed his clothing they sat in the
cool of the evening, for it was now late in June, enjoying
the breeze that floated in from the bay in the
distance. The family brazier was again brought out,
and they sat and smoked and talked the hours away.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And now, father,&#148; said the son, after they had
talked much about the family and things at home,
&#147;you must lie down and sleep, and to-morrow I shall
tell you all about myself. I know you are anxious
to hear, but you must rest now, and then the story
will be the more pleasing. You need have no fear
but you shall hear it all&#151;I am returned, and I
promise I shall not soon again leave you. Goodnight,
and peace for you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">They had no sooner parted and the father gone to
sleep than Shibusawa hastened to change his dress
and once again find his way to the hidden cave. The
time seemed long to him since he had last been there,
and now that he was about to go again he felt that
he never would get started. Just why he wanted
to hurry there he did not know; possibly he had not
consulted reason; yet it was his only hope, and that
was enough to impel him to go.</p>

<p class="indent">As he approached the familiar gate where he had
so often passed he observed that new locks hung
from the latches; that the old guard had gone; that
a haughty, &#147;Who goes there?&#148; greeted his ears, and
suddenly it appeared to him that a great change had
taken place. He realised for the first time that he
was no longer in the land which he had left only a
few years before; that here, too, the seed of progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
had been sown, and that already new sprouts
were bursting forth. He marvelled at the new
order, and a fresh desire came upon him. Suddenly
he turned upon the trusty, and in answer said
convincingly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A friend.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He knew it was of no use to deny his purpose or
make any extended explanation; neither was he willing
nor the guard desirous that he should. Under
the circumstances just one thing would gain his admittance;
none in that land knew better than Shibusawa,
the newly returned, just what results could be
obtained by the judicious use of money. So, when
the pompous keeper jerked his steel from the hip
and held it abreast his chin, with firm footing and
erect body, Shibusawa did not weaken in the least,
but boldly approached and unconcernedly dropped a
coin in the fellow&#146;s convenient hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;All&#146;s well!&#148; shouted the subdued guard, as he
turned his back and lowered his arms, the while
Shibusawa raised the latch and entered at one side
the ponderous gate.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not hesitate nor give the matter further
thought, but hurried on toward the place which to
him bore the most pleasant memory of his life. Each
pebble seemed a guide post, and every step an inspiration.
He tramped on without either stopping or lagging
until the hill had been scaled, and then there
came over him grave feelings of doubt and of dread.
The pathway was no longer clear. The entrance was
a tangled thicket of brier and weeds. He made
further progress with difficulty, and when he had
reached the mouldy place no friendly sight greeted
his eyes. Years of abandonment had obliterated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
everything except her memory. He paused and looked
around, then shuddered, and stumbled toward that
side where once the stone steps had marked the entrance.
They were still bare, though unused; no
trash had gathered there. They were yet as undefiled
as they were on the day he had found Kinsan
lying upon them. He sat down and searched among
the stars for an answer to his heart&#146;s yearnings.</p>

<p class="indent">Long he studied as to what had been her fate.
Each new thought stirred him to greater determination,
every discouragement moved him to plan afresh.
He must find her; yet he sat with his face buried in
his hands; despair overshadowed him. Then he
thought of the old hiding-place, where in days gone by
they were wont to secrete such messages as were
sacred to them alone. He arose and climbed up to
the entrance as if it were but yesterday that he had
been there.</p>

<p class="indent">He raised the wisteria, which had grown heavy and
more dense. Inside the walled den, the webs
stretched thicker and stronger than before. Here
and there a spider paused, then ran his way. There
was no sound, yet a voice bade him enter. He
searched, and in the centre found two stones, placed
one on top of the other. He knew they were
placed there not by accident. Fear overcame him,
and he stood breathless, yet powerless. Then he
stooped and raised the stone, which revealed a
message that to him was sweeter, dearer than all
the world.</p>

<p class="indent">He hastened back to the cave, and seating himself
on the stone steps, where he had pressed her close to
him and listened to her golden words of confidence,
broke the seal from which there unfolded a musty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
sheet that in the light of a smiling moon again spoke
her heart&#146;s content:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#147;<span class="smcap">Dear Love</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is for you that I write. None other is worth
the while. I am going to-morrow where fate has
called me. I have little to offer, except an undying
love; all else is theirs; it is decreed right. But so
long as the soul is and the heart beats, this love shall
be yours and only yours. The spirit which gave it
to you shall keep it for you.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, decree of man, where is your relish! I bow to
your will, but in him is my god. My Shibusawa, my
love, my light! In you life still has hope. Death
shall meet its reward. Think of me a little, do not
judge me harshly, let me live as my heart tells me,
and I shall die happy. The troubles of the earth will
be as the joys of heaven, and you shall be the hand
that guides me, saves me&#151;oh, I love you so! I
cannot live except for you, I shall not die without you.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Believe me, your true love, your sweetheart,</p>

<p class="right">&#147;K.&#146;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The puzzled man read the note again and again
with care, then leaned back in silence. He had
divined only too truly her fate, and when he thought
that possibly she, too, had been put up to the highest
bidder, a feeling of faintness took hold of him and he
bent forward and sat for a long time unable to move
or to decide.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br/>
A MEETING IN THE GARDEN</h2>

<p class="indent">The cock had already crowed before Shibusawa
reached his chamber and lay down to rest.
He could not sleep, but arose and went for a walk in
the woodland bordering the castle grounds. Here
he searched out a secluded spot, where he sat down in
the light of early morning to think and plan. The
air was still and the sun just beginning to pierce the
cool shade of the forest, with here and there a ray of
warmth. Presently the quiet was broken by the
sound of footsteps approaching through the garden,
and looking up he saw Maido coming toward him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Are you here, too, and so early?&#148; said the daimyo,
with a ring of gladness that came from his heart. &#147;I
thought only the elders, like me, enjoyed a sunrise
jaunt among the stately sentinels of time. Come, my
lordship, join me and I&#146;ll show you how a son&#146;s return
affects a father&#146;s legs. It&#146;s many a day since
these old stokies of mind served me as they have this
morning. It reminds me of the time when a mother
brought you to my side. A happy day it was, and
she lies up yonder, my boy, in the tomb, behind the
temple. You may not dislike going there with your
father&#151;will you, this morning?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa may have anticipated the idea, for they
set off together toward the family shrine. The distance
was not great nor the hill steep; just enough to
quicken old age and banter youth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
They did not tarry long at the tomb,&#151;only long
enough to revere the dead and inspire the living,&#151;but
soon arose and retraced their steps a short distance
to where they seated themselves in the shade
of the temple. As they sat they could see afar over
the samurai dwellings and the noised-up city to the
glassy bay in front, or over the castle grounds to the
left, or to the timbered hills on the right. There
they sat and talked at will. Now and then the conversation
drifted back to Shibusawa&#146;s absence, and
each experience related touched more deeply the
father&#146;s slow but certain apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I dare say there are no temples in that far-away
land,&#148; said the lord daimyo, more inquisitive than
positive.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, yes, there are,&#148; was the young prince&#146;s quick
rejoinder, &#147;only they are much larger and less beautiful.
They worship in herds in that country; and
they have a paid supplicant to do the honours, while
the multitude sit and gape and snore. It&#146;s a great
saving of time and trouble, this European method of
salvation.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And have they gods?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, yes; they have a God. The principle is just
the same. It&#146;s only the form that makes it different
from ours.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Ah, the practice! And after all, that is man&#146;s
only reality: the ideal is the grander existence. And
do these strange worshippers have habitations, and
go about clad as we do?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;They have houses&#151;ours are not like theirs,
thanks to good fortune&#151;in which the idea, as in
their churches, is to get as many under one roof as
possible. They build floor over floor, and then wear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
their lives out climbing from one to the other. They
are not only herders but climbers as well. Then the
craze to encroach one upon another is so great that all
try to live at a few isolated spots. There are millions
of broad acres&#151;the area is so great that for want of a
comparison I cannot convey to you anything but a
hazed idea&#151;upon which the sun shines and over
which the fresh air circulates, yet these people hang
out of ten-story windows and pant for breath or
hide away in some dark, damp rooms and stare their
eyes out under the glare of firelight.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Horrors! my son. And they would teach us how
to live?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Not only that, but they cover the streets with
rock and steel and then force iron-wheeled cars over
the rough surface or harsh-sounding rails until the
roar and the clatter make them deaf or drive them
insane.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shocking!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And when they sleep at night they huddle together
under the same quilt, and when they arise and
go about their walled dens or out upon the filth-breeding,
dust-driven streets they cover themselves
with all sorts of coarse material far rougher than our
matting on the floor or the material with which we
sack our products of the field. Their feet are bound
up in close-fitting skins on which are nailed or sewn
stiff leather soles, and their heads are weighted down
with all manner of hot, ill-shaped and wind-catching
hats or other gear.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And is such their clothing?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes. And it is fashioned, mostly, so as to expose
as much as possible the person&#146;s form, or its lines, and
it may be worn, or donned, in piecemeal. It is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
to be commended for street sweeping or fly baiting.
And what a mixture; and so untidy and so uncomfortable!
It makes me creep all over when I think of
it, and of how they swelter on a hot day and freeze
on a cold one.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What barbarians!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And their food! Well, I can best impress you
with that by saying that the cooks and doctors constitute
a large percentage of the population, and that
the mortality resulting from the strife carried on between
the two classes, the one tearing down and the
other building up, is hardly less than frightful. The
science of both is a constant assault upon the stomach,
with the odds so overwhelmingly in favour of the
cooks that life is reduced to an average period of only
some thirty-three years. And the taste, and the
smell! Well, either is farthest removed from nature&#146;s
storehouse, and that is enough said, I warrant.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And that is where you have been seeking knowledge
all this time?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes; I spent only four of the five years at college,
learning how to cheat. Yes, cheat; that is the thing.
First man, then nature. The former, because it is
easy; the latter, because it is progress. And if the
fructifications of a scientist, or a doctor, or a lawyer,
or a preacher, or a merchant, do not meet with your
ideas of success, then try the fortunes of a statesman
or a warrior; and what you cannot get by diplomacy,
force with powder and shot.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And that is what you call Christian civilisation?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is so called.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then shame!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Even so, their progress is none the less.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is the secret?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
&#147;The machine.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The conversation broke off there and they both sat
for a long time absorbed in study. The one looked
backward, the other forward. Neither was satisfied;
man never is.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Shibusawa began rambling over his experiences,
relating first an incident and telling afterwards
of a conquest. His father&#146;s spirits rose, and
they laughed or marvelled together as an amusing
episode or an awkward situation came to mind. He
told of how fortune had compelled him to work his
passage and earn his way from the time he left his
native land until he had returned; of how he had
pushed on from place to place until the American
continent had been crossed, and how in the great city
of New York he had struggled to complete a course in
college. And withal he had been studious and so
frugal that by the time he was graduated he had
saved enough from his earnings to pay his passage to
Europe, thence home again via the Suez Canal and
Hong Kong.</p>

<p class="indent">His experiences had been somewhat unpleasant at
first, but as time passed and he had become accustomed
to work he did not find the necessities of the
situation so irksome. Upon the whole he felt contented
with results, and believed that his search for
knowledge had not been amiss. Although he had
been subjected to keen humiliation and had met with
much hardship, he harboured no ill-feeling toward
the new civilisation which he had encountered. He
freely acknowledged that he appreciated the impossibility
of any assimilation between the Occident and
the Orient, and felt that while the one sojourned with
the other he needs must suffer a disadvantage.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
&#147;While I regret that I have given you cause for so
much anxiety,&#148; continued Shibusawa, &#147;I feel that I
have done nothing to disgrace you, and that the experience
and knowledge gained will sometime serve us
well. In all things pertaining to life there must be a
beginning, and that I have been a pioneer I do not
regret. I shall always endeavour to make the best
use of my opportunities, and I am now ready to take
my proper place.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have spoken well, my son, and Maido is
proud.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after, though late in the morning, they arose
and wended their way toward the castle, and as they
went their interest gradually drifted to matters at
home, including the marriage of Nehachibana. Maido
told his son all about Takara&#146;s recent disappearance
from Tokyo, but mentioned only casually her sojourn
with the Tetsutaishos. Though deeply interested
Shibusawa showed little concern about his wife, and
no criticisms were offered; he appreciated his father&#146;s
situation in the matter and resolved to be considerate.
A deeper thought began to reassert itself, growing
anxiety took hold of him, and he soon became wrapped
with care only for Kinsan.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br/>
AN UNEXPECTED CALL</h2>

<p class="indent">Upon Shibusawa&#146;s arrival at the mansion he
separated from his father and, going to his
own apartments, lay down to rest. The relaxation,
due to a change of solicitude, overcame his feverish
anxiety and soon put him fast asleep. When he
arose, late in the afternoon, he set about his duties as
if no serious problem had ever entered his life, and
when he met Ikamon, his first caller, he proved himself
the master of his own situation.</p>

<p class="indent">The news of Shibusawa&#146;s return had soon spread,
though it created little interest beyond the circle of
his immediate family. There was a time when such
an occurrence would have been heralded as an important
event, but now the lord daimyo no longer
held the sway he once did. True, there was no falling
off in his power, and indirectly no slackening of his
influence; still that influence had come to be exercised
largely through the medium of Ikamon, and Maido&#146;s
wealth and position were more and more accounted as
the latter&#146;s strength.</p>

<p class="indent">Going away from home at so early an age and remaining
away for so long a time, Shibusawa had
never become well known at Tokyo, and almost
ceased to be taken into account in reckoning the
family&#146;s political or social status. Though Maido&#146;s
neglect, occasioned largely by grief for his absent son,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
had enabled Ikamon to gradually appropriate to his
own use the family&#146;s place and wealth, it was not so
intended; and nobody knew better than the wily
son-in-law himself that default rather than purpose
permitted him to enjoy the almost unlimited use of
another&#146;s fortune. When Shibusawa returned, Ikamon
therefore hastened to cultivate with the son that
same friendly intercourse which he had always enjoyed
with the father. In consequence he extended
to his relative a hearty greeting, which to his surprise
met with a generous response.</p>

<p class="indent">This readiness to take the hand of fellowship did not
arise from any lack of understanding, nor could its
motive be in the least questioned. Shibusawa desired
to cultivate a better acquaintance with his
father&#146;s associates and contemporaries as well as to
meet and revive old friendships. Persistency rapidly
bore its fruit, for not alone his rank, but his superior
education and polish gave him place, while his quiet,
unobtrusive manner brought him into respect with
all the more progressive of the shogun&#146;s court.</p>

<p class="indent">In matters of state Maido had gradually released
his hold, and now that he had grown old and less inclined
to assume the responsibility he began to long
for the freedom of the country. The son, as best he
could, assumed those duties which of necessity must
sooner or later have devolved entirely upon him, and
together they planned so well that by autumn they
were enabled to determine upon returning for an indefinite
period to their home province, Kanazawa.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Your long continued and able service,&#148; said Ikamon
with enthusiasm, when advised of their plans,
&#147;demands some recognition at the hands of those
who can ill afford to lose your presence at court. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
to me, sir, it is the greatest pleasure of my life to offer
some entertainment to my friends and to your friends
and to be permitted the privilege. Come, my good
Maido, you shall not say no, and Shibusawa, I venture,
will not.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;My son-in-law, my Ikamon, your good protestations
overwhelm me. I certainly do not deserve such
kindly notice. I cannot make you a ready answer&#151;Shibusawa,
will you be so good as to speak for me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, father,&#148; said the son, politely bowing. &#147;If
his highness, the prime minister, so desires, I feel that
it is a great privilege to acknowledge the honour.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And Ikamon shall make the occasion worthy the
guests,&#148; said the designing official, enthusiastic over
the prospects.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Maido and his family could not make so important
a move without first obtaining the consent of
the shogun, and as this rested primarily with the prime
minister, Shibusawa may have had good reason for so
quickly acceding to the doing of what he knew to be
tainted with something more than mere friendship.
They earnestly desired the privilege of absenting
themselves from the capital, not alone that Maido
might enjoy the freedom of his former life and the
intercourse with his people, but that Shibusawa
might begin his active career at home, where he could
better become acquainted, and familiarise himself
with the needs and resources of the prefecture.
Maido, now in his declining years, also craved the
liberty of his child&#146;s companionship freed from the
cares of court life, especially that there were no pressing
duties at the capital. He therefore set forth his
reasons and requests in a letter, forthwith despatched
to the department.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
The answer soon came back at the hands of Ikamon
himself, who, as a mark of extreme deference, took
along for the first time his respected wife, Yasuko, a
courtesy which so pleased Maido that he never forgot
the incident. Indeed, they were received with so
much cordiality that the set call was soon turned
into an informal affair, and the little party did not
break up until a late hour. After refreshments had
been served they sat pleasantly chatting, the two
elders about matters interesting to them, thus leaving
Yasuko and Shibusawa to indulge themselves as
they liked.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Shibusawa&#146;s first real opportunity to hear the
neighbourhood gossip, and while not at all a busybody
he took advantage of the occasion to learn some of
the doings affecting him most. But Yasuko was little
given to gadding about, and in consequence not as
conversant with the neighbourhood affairs as some
others. Indeed, she had never heard of such a person
as Kinsan,&#151;nor did Shibusawa suspect that she
had ever had an opportunity or reason to hear of
one in her caste,&#151;therefore, however much desired,
though not expected, he gained no information in that
direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I do wish you would try to see Nehachibana before
you go away to Kanazawa. I fear it may be a
long time, Shibusawa, before you shall again have a
chance.&#148; said Yasuko, earnestly, while they were
alone and out of hearing distance of the rest of those
present.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I should very much like to,&#148; answered he, interestedly;
&#147;but I am so prejudiced against that husband
of hers, Tetsutaisho, that I almost dread to go.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But she is so disconsolate! And, poor thing, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
is jealous, and yet so wrapped up in him. I wonder
she does not do some dreadful thing.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I presume I shall have to go there or not see her
at all.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She seldom goes away from the house, and when
she does her mother-in-law goes foremost, you can be
sure of that.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well, I shall manage in some way before I go,
though probably it will not be until later. I shall
have to encounter the husband first.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, do, Shibusawa; I shall be so glad, and I know
it will cheer her up. You remember that she was
always so fond of you, and you may be able to
encourage her. Please do not fail.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Very well; I promise you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Ikamon came toward them, and the conversation
was changed to something less personal.
Then after a few pleasantries the callers began to
make ready to take leave.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I dare say,&#148; said Ikamon, adroitly, as they were
about to leave the house, &#147;Yasuko has enjoyed this
evening; her brother is seldom absent from her mind,
and did I not share the same good trait I certainly
should be a little jealous. Yes, sir; we think of you
and your good father often, and we regret to see you
going so far away from us. Yet we hope that the
country will not hold you long, and that you will soon
be returning to the capital, where you are so exceedingly
welcome, and so illy spared.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">While it pleased Shibusawa to see such good cheer
and hear praise bestowed upon his father, the encomium
did not in any manner carry him away nor
cause him to suspect the giver; he merely passed it
by as a personal trait, without any regard to the real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
source of its apparent emanation. Secretly he had
long ago determined that he and his family, or any
other, would be courted just so long as they made
themselves worth the while. He appreciated Ikamon&#146;s
kindness in suggesting the entertainment, and,
regardless of the motive or consequences, proposed
to enjoy such benefits as were of right his portion, so
long as no moral or material right was infringed upon.</p>

<p class="indent">After consulting Maido&#146;s convenience as to the
time of the entertainment, Ikamon and his wife withdrew
amid hearty salutations and started toward
their home. The sky was clear and the moon up as
they sped along in the cool of night, listening to the
patter of the carriers&#146; feet, or looking out upon the
world of beauty around them. Theirs was a happy
contrast with those less fortunate, for&#151;even in
feudal Japan&#151;this mighty statesman once delved
into mother earth for meagre sustenance. There, too,
the lowly rose to power and fame, and, as the great
minister leaned back under the golden canopy and
sniffed the balmy air floating in at the open sides, he
marvelled at his own success and swelled with pride
at his extraordinary rise.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is the power of logic that sends men on their
destined way. The sway of chance or the hand of
justice has little to do with the mysteries of man&#146;s
universe; it is the certainty of the thing that counts
for much. The success makes right, and Ikamon
knows no wrong,&#148; said he to himself as they came
close to their gilded mansion and a hundred tired
backs welcomed the small relief.</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon arose and stepped out of the tasselled chair,
and stood waiting to assist Yasuko. Ready and
willing maids had already spread the leopard skin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
and as she thrust forward her dainty, white stockinged
feet, two gold-lacquered shoes were placed for
them. Her husband extended his hand, and she
arose, gracefully walking toward the house where is
known &#147;the golden crow&#148; and &#147;the jewelled hare,&#148;
the law&#146;s luxury and man&#146;s inheritance.</p>

<p class="indent">The prime minister drew from his girdle a string of
&#147;cash&#148; which he scattered, and a horde of thankful
underlings scrambled for the bounty. He too entered
the privileged house, and soon after, taking his
proper leave, retired to his own chamber, where he
planned and schemed the grandest geisha party that
his age had known.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br/>
THE GEISHA PARTY</h2>

<p class="indent">The giving of a geisha party such as Ikamon proposed
involved no small amount of preparation
and entailed much thought and care, yet when the
&#147;Harvest Moon&#148; came&#151;for that was the time selected&#151;everything
had been gotten in readiness,
and Maido and his family occupied their booth, surrounded
by all that luxury and refinement could offer
to still the cares of man. Shibusawa entered into the
spirit of the occasion with every possible determination
to do his part, but down in his heart there lived
a yearning, and with each repeated failure came a
corresponding hope for Kinsan. He had sought her
long and earnestly, and now grasped at each straw.
&#147;Would she, could she be there that night?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The young prince could not avoid facing Takara,
who sat to his left, across the big auditorium, and each
look from her burned into him a still deeper sense of
his ingratitude. Tetsutaisho occupied an adjoining
booth, and no color in Shibusawa&#146;s cheek escaped
his eye. An inner consciousness smote him, and he
looked out into the brilliant scene before him for
relief.</p>

<p class="indent">And as he became transported, that subtile, elusive
something seemed all but there, for the geisha party,
the universal and proper form, probably fits the case
quite as well as any other opera or means devised for
the diversion of mankind. Here, in ancient Japan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
it is the very acme of united, contributive art, and
whether the affair be a small or a grand one matters
not; the ever festive and elastic geisha meets the
emergency. If but the modest return of a chance
relation, whereupon the trifling consequences of a
happy trade in jack-knives is discussed, or if it be the
social f&#234;te, where the destinies of a monarch are
framed and harangued, the geisha party is the occasion,
and it stands for all that opportunity may or
can require. No demand can be too exacting, no
hope too flattering. It paves the way to good-fellowship,
and inspires the heart to nobler deeds. Ikamon
chose it as a means for bringing together the
best in the land, and he used it as an instrument
to touch them, to sway and move them.</p>

<p class="indent">The matter of finding a suitable place had worried
him, and going in person to all of the noted tea houses,
one after another, he discarded them as being inadequate
or impracticable. Ryogoku, Tsukiji, Asakusa,
and others in turn were visited, and none offered
suitable accommodation. His wants were exacting,
and as he went from place to place his imagination
grew and requirements multiplied beyond all hope of
fulfilment.</p>

<p class="indent">Uyeno pleased him most; here he found at least an
ideal spot, endowed by nature with all that is lofty
and inspiring. The spacious park lay upon a gently
sloping hillside, terminating in a high promontory,
jutting out over the nestling roof tops far below.
From the quiet of its level there stretched away to
the right, to the left, and in front, a million earnest,
faithful homes. The glistening, silvered waters in
the distance had again and again marked the stately
course of the splendid &#147;Harvest Moon&#148; in her onward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
march with time, while from the background
came the breathless hush of the forest, the silent
mysteries of the gloom, the awakening of the spirit
world. He returned to it a second and a third time,
studied the situation at its best, then decided.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The &#145;Harvest Moon&#146; is the time,&#148; said he, with
ecstasy, &#147;and the shogun&#146;s command will amply
build the playhouse. I shall begin without delay.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The prime minister returned to his home much
pleased with himself and fully satisfied with his opportunities.
True, the allotted few weeks were a
short time, but what mattered that when he had only
to advise and the scene of his intended activities
would swarm with a myriad of workers. And then
the applause for its doing!&#151;for Ikamon loved gain,
and he knew of no surer means than the approval of
his countrymen. He said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;There have been geisha parties before, other f&#234;tes
of note, but it is now Ikamon&#146;s turn. Why not only
outstrip the past, but anticipate the future?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">In consequence the necessary work was begun and
the party launched by the most sweeping and unheard
of orders. As in the matter of construction,
the invitations had been issued under order of the
shogun, and no royal personage or noble blood of the
sex was overlooked or neglected. Messengers despatched
in every direction had set moving long before
the harvest moon had risen many gorgeous trains;
for no host or guest in that land was held in better
esteem than Maido, the lord daimyo of Kanazawa.
They came from north and south, from the loyal and
the opposition, from kuge and bakufu.[<a href="#index14">14</a><a name="fn14" id="fn14"></a>] All were his
friends, and none would miss an opportunity to enjoy
the hospitality that flowed from the shogun&#146;s seat
like balm in Gilead or wine from a Circean cup.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
They came, and when they had arrived they beheld
the grandest spectacle that they had ever known.
Many thousands had laboured hard to set the scene and
perfect the play. Early in its inception Ikamon had
instructed Tetsutaisho as to his portion; whereupon
the responsive commander constructed around the
plot of a hundred acres a living wall, in which each
stone was a trained soldier and every picket a sharpened
steel.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a massing of troops had never before been
seen, and Tetsutaisho had not only girdled the festive
place with a brilliant setting, but taught those lords
and barons a lesson in fanciful show that convinced
them of the shogun&#146;s effective strength. The human
fence ended only at either side of the promontory,
whereat gates were placed, over which a thousand
blades stood guard. No force could pass that barrier.
To them it seemed insurmountable from without and
impenetrable from within.</p>

<p class="indent">Within the cordon of militia, however, the real wonders
of the place began to unfold. Passing through
the gate the guests were taken in hand and ushered
along down the lines of dazzling soldiery toward the
lower end of the park, where stood a dark, dense
forest. Here they suddenly left the bright lights behind
and were made to grope their way through the
woods to the yawning entrance of an underground
cave. Thence through its gloomy caverns beset with
all the horrors of an imagined hades they hurried
until they had finally emerged into the brilliant lights
of the grand auditorium.</p>

<p class="indent">On the left side of the entrance was the mikado&#146;s
booth, and on the right the shogun&#146;s: neither was
better or grander than the other, but both were covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
with gorgeous brocades of maple leaves and
banked with solid walls of chrysanthemums. Coloured
lanterns hung between the pillars in front, and
open windows looked out at the back upon the city
below. From the two gala booths in the centre, the
royal booths stretched out on either side, skirting the
brow of the hill, in the shape of a crescent, graduating
in size to correspond to the several grades of
nobility. To the stage in front alternate beds of
flowers and open boxes, with here and there a mat-covered
aisle, occupied the space. The boxes were laid
with soft mats and lined with silk, while the booths
were made of gold or black lacquer, with tiger or
leopard skins on the floor, as suited the rank of the
occupant.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa looked out under the high roof, with its
thousand-tinted, leaf-covered cone, emblazoned with
dazzling lights and brilliant foliage, at the red-lacquered
stage, festooned with wisteria and lined with
the beautiful bell-shaped asagao. The guests were
already seated in their flowing robes of silk and purple
amid garlands of flowers and booths of gold, and
the players began to make their appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Three hundred geisha singers dressed in flaming
uniforms, wearing costly jewels in their hair, came
first, seating themselves in three rows across the front
of the stage, with the samisens[<a href="#index15">15</a><a name="fn15" id="fn15"></a>] first, the kokyus[<a href="#index16">16</a><a name="fn16" id="fn16"></a>] next,
and the kotos last. Next after these came nine hundred
geisha dancers, who ranked in lines at both sides
and at the rear of the stage. After them one hundred
geisha singers, whose simple coiffures and freedom
from ornamentation bespoke their purity, came
in and grouped themselves in the centre of the stage.
All held themselves in readiness to begin the play.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
Presently the music began in faint, weird strains, and
as the time quickened the dancers began to sway,
and as the pitch rose the singers began to chant; and
when all seemed a living, moving, sounding picture,
the ranks parted and down between them softly
stepped a maiden whose charm and ease of manner
made breathless the waiting listeners.</p>

<p class="indent">As she approached the centre of the stage, the
music lowered, the dancers slowed, and the singers
gradually stopped; then her voice began its soft, enchanting
notes. Every man leaned forward speechless;
and as she sang her song of love they were
thrilled with the wondrous message of her heart. In
that vast audience there was one who understood the
language of her pathos, who communed with her soul.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Shibusawa; and not words, but actions revealed
the secret of his feelings. He sat in his booth,
leaning over, and silent. He did not grieve, nor exult,
but sat there a dweller in another world. It was
one from the spirit land with whom he spoke. She
told him she loved him; her voice, not words carried
the message, spoke the language of her soul. He
listened, and when the farewell came would have
gone to her, thrown himself at her feet, had not his
strength failed him. He hesitated, and upon regaining
his composure Kinsan had gone&#151;he knew not
where.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho sat near Shibusawa, and he too felt
the force of her great melody, and knew that some
inward action moved her. He had long before
guessed her secret, and Shibusawa&#146;s strange emotion
now impressed him. Instinctively connecting the
two, though holding his own counsel, he knew from
that day who his rival was, and he felt that her song
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
had won for her its reward. He chided himself for
having yielded to Ikamon&#146;s entreaty, and wished
that he had denied even his best friend the favour of
her loan. It was now too late. The mistake had
been made beyond rectifying.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan had not observed Shibusawa, or at least
did not distinguish him in the audience, but sang
purely and simply from her heart. No incentive
moved her, nor did she heed the elegance, or feel the
great honour she had gained. She was conscious of
only one, and in another world poured out her soul&#146;s
desire; and thus without being aware of it brought to
her feet the noble, royal sons of a nation, made them
her slaves, and went forth from that scene the most
famed of her sex.</p>

<p class="indent">Thenceforth it was &#147;Kinsan, The Nightingale,&#148;
and she bore well the sobriquet.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br/>
THE UNHAPPY MEETING</h2>

<p class="indent">The beautiful song of the unknown star had
stimulated the most hearty good cheer, and the
playing, feasting, and conversation did not wane until
a late hour. And when the festivities had ended,
Ikamon was accounted the prince of entertainers;
while Shibusawa confronted a new danger.</p>

<p class="indent">When the guests had gone home his father began
making preparations to go to Kanazawa. Maido,
pleased with the reception accorded him, felt highly
complimented for his long and faithful services at the
capital. He deemed it a fitting finale to what he considered
the close of his active public career, and the
honour seemed to him a splendid reward. And now
that so much had been done by his friends in appreciation
of his services and in recognition of his retirement,
he believed himself in duty bound to show his
proper regard by making his exit as elaborate as his
circumstances would permit. Therefore he called
his son to him and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shibusawa, we have been honoured at the hands
of our friends and especially are we under obligation
to the court. Let us be equally generous in our withdrawal
from life at the capital, and depart with a
procession that will show due appreciation, and declare
our loyalty to his august highness. We have
always been modest in our pretensions, and I believe
that some such demonstration would not be unfitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
or beneath the dignity of our station. What do you
say, my son?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;If it is your pleasure, I certainly can see no valid
objection. We need not be ashamed of such showing
as we can make, and real display is sometimes a
good promoter and always a splendid encouragement.
What can I do to be of service?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Please consider yourself my guest; that will better
suit me, since it may be my last opportunity. Once
the young get a good hold, there is little chance for the
fathers. Let me do the thing once more, then surrender
to you. The last is the greater.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Very well, if you like, Shibusawa will obey;
there is no greater pleasure, nor higher honour.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa not only wished to please his father
but was glad for the opportunity to occupy himself in
another way. Since his startling discovery of Kinsan
he had resolved to find her and claim her, whatever
might be the cost. He reasoned that his agitation
upon seeing Kinsan on the stage would be passed as
merely an incident, and that no explanation would
be required; and that he take no steps that might
involve his family, he deemed it advisable to keep his
own counsel until, if necessary, developments necessitated
some sort of disclosure. Tetsutaisho had
said nothing, and in consequence Shibusawa did not
know of any suspicion on his part; and being entirely
unaware of Kinsan&#146;s residence he had, of course,
no reason whatever to suppose that she was domiciled
at his brother-in-law&#146;s house. His idolised queen had
appeared to him as if in a vision, and the more he
pondered the situation the more deeply he became
perplexed.</p>

<p class="indent">And as the days rapidly passed and his allotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
time shortened, Shibusawa began to grow nervous
and despair of his mission. All his friends with whom
he could discuss the new prima donna were even
more than he in the dark; they had never heard of
her and like himself could get no information as to
where she could even be found. He rightly refrained
from saying anything to Ikamon, the only
person besides Tetsutaisho who could have informed
him; and even had he approached him he would
have received no encouragement, for the prime minister
had promised faithfully to keep her identity a
secret. From day to day the disconsolate young
prince went from friend to friend and place to place
discussing the crowning feature of the big event, in
hope of getting some bit of information that would
serve as a clue. In geisha circles they were equally
mystified, and from that source no encouragement
could be offered. He became disheartened, though
more than ever resolved.</p>

<p class="indent">The time for his departure from the city had already
arrived, and before going he set out to make
his sister, Yasuko, a parting call. While there, she
for a second time cautioned him about his going to see
Nehachibana; whereupon he promised forthwith to
go and bid his favourite sister farewell, even though
he had not as yet made up his mind to forgive or become
friendly with her husband. Shortening his
visit with Yasuko, accordingly, he kept his promise
and immediately went to call upon Nehachibana.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a gloomy day, and the clouds hung low and
drove cold the chill of autumn. The dusk of night
already overshadowed the earth and he felt uneasy,
much disliking to disturb even his sister at so late an
hour; yet he knew that it would be his only chance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
for on the morrow he must make ready to take his
departure. As he approached the house no one
greeted him; he hesitated; resolving to meet her if
possible, he pressed forward, making known his desire
to see Nehachibana, his sister.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not long to wait, however, for she came in
person and greeting him warmly bade him enter the
house and sit in her own chamber. Here they sat
and sat, he listening, and she pouring out her troubles&#151;it
had been her first opportunity in all those pent-up
years. Again and again they had drained their
teacups when, flushed and excited, she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, there is a son, and you must know its mother.
I will show it to you and then you can better appreciate
my terrible sorrow. Oh, I cannot bear it
longer! It will kill me, and yet it is no fault of mine.
I have been a dutiful wife, and I have the only right
to be the mother of his children. Tell me, Shibusawa,
my brother, is there no help for woman?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is the law of the land, Nehachibana, and as
long as it is such, it is our duty to abide by its decree.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But the law is so unjust!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The injustice is in the making of it. But there,
now, let us not discuss that any further. You have
done your part, and I will venture it is better a husband
whom you love, than a wife who loves your
husband. Come, now, when shall I expect you to
pay us a visit in the country?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I wish you were not going so far. I am seldom
allowed such a privilege, and were I&#151;oh, that
other one! I should never give her the satisfaction.
I hate her! I love&#151;oh, I dare not, I cannot go away!
Come with me, now, won&#146;t you? I want you to see&#151;to
see with your own eyes&#151;I shall have revenge!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
&#147;But you must not, my dear Nehachibana. It
is not she that has wronged you; and it is a terrible
thing to misjudge. Better suffer the wrong; the
charity will repay you the sacrifice.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then look, as I have done these many days, and
you will know better a woman&#146;s way. It is an image
of the devil, and its eyes rivet me. Come?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To please you, Nehachibana.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana arose and stealthily disappeared; in
a few moments she returned and, scarcely speaking
above a whisper, bade Shibusawa follow. Guiding
him through several rooms, into a long passageway,
thence to a chamber out of which a soft light shone
through the frail paper partition, she cautioned him,
then pushed back the slide a little and beckoned him
approach. Kinsan sat in deep thought near a small
screen, with the child fondled in her lap, and for the
moment did not observe their entrance. She had
often been intruded upon in such a manner and therefore
paid little heed. Perhaps she meditated the
night of her d&#233;but upon the stage; or she may have
been thinking of another time when all the world
seemed glorified to her. The visitors approached,
however, and their stockinged feet made hardly any
noise on the soft, matted floor. They came at Kinsan&#146;s
back, partly sidewise, and when not too far
away Nehachibana clutched at Shibusawa&#146;s kimono
and pointing her bony finger at the child, leaned forward
and said, almost breathlessly:</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 466px;"><a name="i_172fp" id="i_172fp"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_172fp.jpg" width="466" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Kinsan sat in deep thought ... with the child fondled in her lap.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is he!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She trembled violently, and her eyes stared wildly
as they came in contact with the child. Until Nehachibana
spoke, Kinsan had not recognised them,
nor would she then have done so had not Shibusawa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
sprung forward to save Nehachibana from falling as
she reeled and lost her balance. Shibusawa had recognised
Kinsan the moment Nehachibana spoke, and
it was a hard struggle for him to refrain from speaking
to her. His whole being bade him respond to an
overpowering impulse, but sober thought checked
him, and he grasped at an opportunity to turn his
back by leading Nehachibana away.</p>

<p class="indent">This movement, however, did not serve to shield
him, for before he had entirely turned about Kinsan
saw his face and knew him, and sprang to her feet,
while the child fell to the floor. Though her very
being flamed she did not follow, but stood speechless
and helpless; there was no force to move her. She
waited, and presently he returned.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa led his sister back to her apartment
and left her under promise that she would try to regain
her composure and remain there until he came
for her. He told her that he desired to meet the
child&#146;s mother privately, but would return to her in a
short time.</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana said nothing to relieve her brother&#146;s
mind. She knew in her own heart that Kinsan was
not the mother of the child, yet she did not speak.
He, of course, took it for granted that the child was
hers. He got only a glance, but saw in its eyes a
familiar image; also in that he was misinformed.
Had it been a woman who saw, she would not have
made so grave a mistake; reason is sometimes the
victim of deception; intuition, never.</p>

<p class="indent">As he returned, he judged. Every step deadened
his feelings and each thought blinded his reason. He
conjured her false, and made himself the victim.
He re-entered the room, sternly and deliberately; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
stood there, hopeful and expectant. As he stepped
inside she came forward, but before reaching him
stopped and bowed in silence; she had divined his
heart and read correctly the message. The child
cried playfully, and she blushed deeply and confusedly.
She realised fully the possible consequences
of its being there, and would have hastened to explain
had he given her the opportunity; on the contrary he
approached and said calmly, but coldly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Kinsan, I would like a word with you, if you will
so permit me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She raised her hands and looked at him with pleading,
earnest eyes, but he made no offer to meet her.
His arms hung limp, and his look fell to the floor. She
waited for him to recover, to deign some word or act
of encouragement. Perhaps he battled for power;
perhaps he accused her. He made no sign, and she
recovered herself and calmly asked him:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Will you please be seated?</p>

<p class="indent">They sat down upon the clean white floor; the
child lay coaxing in front of them. Neither offered
a remark, but both sat in serious contemplation. It
was he who first attempted to break the silence, and as
he ventured to speak the partition in front slid back with
a jerk, and Tetsutaisho walked forward and bowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I trust I am not intruding,&#148; said he, as he waited
for Shibusawa to arise.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I beg your pardon, sir,&#148; said the younger of the
two, rising and drawing his kimono about him. &#147;It
is I who seem to be unwelcome. Therefore please
grant me the privilege of retiring.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;As you like,&#148; said the other, with an air of disinterestedness
and a low bow. &#147;Tetsutaisho welcomes
his friends, always.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
&#147;And Shibusawa recognises his enemies, now and
then,&#148; retorted he with a courteous bow, as he gracefully
withdrew from their presence.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa hurried back to Nehachibana&#146;s room
where he found her sitting and staring into space.
Her features were expressionless, and her toilet
showed a carelessness which until now had escaped
his notice. He said a few kindly words to her, and
retiring, hastened toward his own home. She paid
little heed to what he said, and when he warmly gave
her a parting farewell she blankly answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sayonara.&#148;[<a href="#index17">17</a><a name="fn17" id="fn17"></a>]</p>

<p class="indent">The disconsolate young man went home with a
sadder heart and firmer determination than ever. He
was fully convinced that Kinsan had been untrue,
yet in charity he charged her failure to the law&#146;s
barrier. At first he had been stunned, and his love
momentarily wavered; but as he gained freedom and
more carefully reflected, his heart withstood the test
and his mind regained its composure; and when he
arose the next morning he set himself to his task with
a will that knows no better victory than constancy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br/>
DAIMYO&#146;S PROCESSION</h2>

<p class="indent">The final preparations for the gorgeous procession
progressed without interruption all of the
next day, notwithstanding a light rain fell almost incessantly,
and Shibusawa, at least, regretted though
encouraged a speedy going. He must on the very
eve of Kinsan&#146;s discovery part with what seemed to
be the last hope of ever realising his life&#146;s ambition.
And she the property of his bitterest enemy! Sometimes
it seemed more than he could bear; but a recurring
sense of the inevitable always stayed the doing
of some rash thing, and long before the evening had
passed friends were calling to bid the family good-bye.</p>

<p class="indent">As night came on, however, the rain ceased, and
the weather began to clear under a stiff breeze blowing
from the eastward. It was a chill October night,
the leaves were falling, and the white clouds sped low
in the sky. The sun had fringed the western horizon
with a snowy-fleeced red, and Shibusawa stepped to
the outer edge of his veranda to take a parting glimpse
of the golden scene spread over the hills above. He
could not see the site of the hidden cave, but his eyes
moistened; he turned away and looked toward the
lake below.</p>

<p class="indent">There he saw emerging from a cluster of bushes
Okyo, tugging along a coy maiden, whose dress and
appearance signified that she did not belong to the
castle; yet he observed her neat and modest appearance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
also that Okyo endeavoured with difficulty to
induce her to approach. Shibusawa drew back and
waited their coming with amusement, if not interest.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they came near, and after much consultation
and persuasion on Okyo&#146;s part they entered
the house and groped their way hand in hand&#151;he
pulling and she shying&#151;into Shibusawa&#146;s presence.
Okyo saluted his master, she courtesied; between
them they stammered an explanation, and the host
begged forgiveness for the unseemly confusion of
identities.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And this is Shiyoganai, the pretty young girl
whom we rescued while guests at the Look-See tea
house. Let us see, that is several years ago, and I
am afraid our claim is now more than forfeited.
However, I suppose the double is fancied and the bargain
might be renewed,&#148; said the young prince, in a
manner intended to place them at ease, and save the
direct embarrassment of a possible recognition.</p>

<p class="indent">The unexpected rather upset Okyo, and a feeling
somewhat akin to fright suddenly came over him. He
said nothing; his voice failed him, and hanging his head
he partly turned and whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You tell it, Shiyoganai; I can&#146;t.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She blushed deeply, and told the story of how Okyo
had again met her after his venture upon the sea and
with his meagre assistance saved her from being sold
a second time, possibly into something worse than
slavery. She added with much hesitation that they
had dearly loved each other for a long time, and
asked him to be so kind as to let Okyo come back
sometime to see her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tell him that I want to marry you,&#148; interposed
her would-be suitor, boldly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
&#147;And are you both quite sure you wish to take so
serious a step?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, yes, we are,&#148; said they in chorus, scarcely
the words left his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you shall marry and welcome, for I shall
want you to remain here with the keeper until I
return.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa tendered Okyo the funds necessary to
make settlement with her parents and bade them
expedite the marriage, as he must move early on the
morrow and should certainly expect them to be punctually
on hand. Nor did they waste time, but hurriedly
saluted and were not seen again until late the next
morning, when Shiyoganai came trudging in, was forgiven
and seemed happy.</p>

<p class="indent">The daimyo&#146;s procession had started to move betimes,
and was well on the way before the streets had
quieted down for the midday. The parade had been
so well noised about that the roads were everywhere
lined with the interested and the curious. Flags and
bunting were displayed and many shops had been
closed in honour of the event. By common consent the
occasion had been turned into a general holiday in
honour of the man whose sympathy had endeared
him to both prince and pauper alike; and as the
pageant moved along there was presented to view a
strikingly imposing scene.</p>

<p class="indent">Over forty thousand men were in line, and among
them many dignitaries, who had been invited and
who chanced to join as a mark of respect and an act
of loyalty. The swordsmen, under the command of
Beppu, a trusted officer of the daimyo&#146;s forces,
marched in the lead; after these came the spearsmen;
then the fieldsmen; and then the courtiers, retainers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
members of the household, servants, criers, and
hangers-on. Groups of knightly heralds, in costumes
of white and gold, carried high, massive plumes of
green and brown; there were couriers with flaming
banners, gorgeous floats, flags, streamers, and bunting;
huge grotesque figures and other monstrosities wabbled
along on human backs, while gilded poles and
clever symbols lined the imposing column. Gaudy
uniforms and costly dress told of the wealth and
pomp that followed in the splendid train, and the
great chairs of state bespoke Maido&#146;s power and the
splendour of his suite. On the door at either side of
these rich palanquins shone the family crest, worked
into the beautiful lacquer with finely threaded gold
and silver, in the design of five circles around ten
short rays representing sword punctures. The
daimyo&#146;s chair came first in line, then Shibusawa&#146;s.
After all the rest there followed long trains laden with
baggage and paraphernalia belonging to the household
and retainers of the family.</p>

<p class="indent">The procession moved in double file along the old
Tokaido, the deep-worn and hard-packed highway
with its tall cedars and interlocking branches on
either side. Here they travelled in solemn grandeur
as their ancestors of a thousand years had done, and
Maido marvelled at the beauty of the ceremony and
thought with pride of the splendour of his retinue.
His army was counted legion and his income over a
million koku,[<a href="#index18">18</a><a name="fn18" id="fn18"></a>] while the doors of nobility were open
to him and royalty pleased with his friendship. He
had in effect just closed a brilliant career, and his own
son about to succeed him he believed capable of winning
new laurels&#151;why should he not swell with
satisfaction as he rode along beneath the shade of
these giants of the forest?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
Shibusawa, on the other hand, had begun to take
a deeper hold on life. He had seen the world, and
felt keenly the narrow pride which the lords and
rulers of his land boasted.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew their tiny empire to be a beauteous land,
and he also knew that it had been discovered; that
there were other people from whom the good things
of the earth could not be kept. He also realised that
they themselves had much to profit by the larger
intercourse certainly to come, and that they, too, with
all their excellence were far from being perfect in the
scale of social organisation. He had seen sufficient
of life and imbibed enough of truth to understand
that so long as inequality exists between men just so
long will the state remain flexible; and he realised
that such a government must necessarily adapt itself
to natural conditions. He had looked out into the
world and there beheld the glory of man, not men;
and he now believed in man&#146;s regeneration as born of
progression.</p>

<p class="indent">They tramped on day after day in their only
fashion, and when they finally did arrive at their own
gate Shibusawa sprang from his chair and amid the
shouts of the men ran on at double the speed. For
this he was held in high esteem and accounted one of
their kind, though some of the dignitaries may have
been a little surprised at the young prince&#146;s democracy.
While Maido, out of deference to his station,
said nothing, at least he really rejoiced, for he loved
a good sprinter and had actually winked at more than
one wrestling match in his day.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I would get out and go you a bout myself, were it
not for shocking the household keeper&#146;s sensibilities,&#148;
said he to his son, quietly, as the latter was about to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
leave his chair for the coveted run through the woods
and over the hills.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa&#146;s fleetness brought him, before many
hours had passed, to the selfsame gate behind which
most of his boyhood days had been spent. He drew
a deep breath as he entered, and while walking along
the old winding road to the main front he said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What is sweeter and better than the environment
of early home?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He immediately, upon entering, set himself to
work directing a few added touches that would please
and encourage his father&#146;s home-coming. Such
trifling attentions he accounted a great pleasure, and
as he grew older in appreciation of a parent&#146;s tenderness
he lost no opportunity to show his affectionate
esteem. Nor did he misplace even one, for Maido
in his way repaid the trouble many fold.</p>

<p class="indent">When they had arrived at Kanazawa, the season
had so far advanced that they at once settled down
for the winter. Though disappointed in not being
able to visit other parts of the prefecture, they took
much satisfaction in the quiet of their country house,
and Magokoro (the real or red heart, or maple leaves)
smiled sweetly and soon the snow fell beautifully.
They did not lack for plenty to do and see, and when
once settled there was much company, for Maido had
been gone for a long time and his neighbours were not
only glad at having seen him return, but some of the
mikado&#146;s court, not far distant, were interested in
knowing the reason.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was Takara disinterested, though she did not
call. And a certain prince who had once upon a
time been deeply in love with her and who was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
quite attentive, manifested more than an interest; he
was anxious, and upon Shibusawa&#146;s return he at first
took it upon himself to visit Kanazawa rather often.
Aside from these personal attractions, the south
brewed a storm that was destined to spread until it
had claimed the attention of some persons even much
farther north than Kanazawa. Thus plenty both of
interest and variety engaged Maido, nor would Shibusawa
flinch from his part.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br/>
SHIBUSAWA RECLAIMED</h2>

<p class="indent">It was now some considerable time since Takara
had been spirited by the ronin from Tokyo to
Kyoto, where she had gone into seclusion at her
mother&#146;s house and so remained. The gaiety at
court had little attraction for her, and she undertook
to devote herself to a new life which should
atone for all past failures. She had had her trial with
men, and placing them all in the same category undertook
to discard them as so much rubbish.</p>

<p class="indent">One day while discussing the matter with Daikomitsu
she said to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;They are disappointing and, I believe, a burden to
the real woman. No, Daikomitsu, you could not have
me, were I free and you made of gold. I prefer another
kind of happiness.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You do not mean what you say, Takara. You
are chafing a bit under the weight of your misfortunes.
You have my sympathy and my love too,
if you will.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I have a husband.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And of what sort? I vow not of your own choice.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A woman has no choice.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nor should she; nor would she, had I the say.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Thanks. I understand there are some would-be
friends who are interested in all that goes with feudalism
except the inheritance. You might have that,
were you as clever as they.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&#147;I belong to the literati.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, you do? It is strange; I had heard nothing
of that since you were here last. I trust it will not
get noised around too much&#151;Ikamon might hear it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Well?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He is worth the while.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tetsutaisho&#146;s the better man. I like him.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then he has told you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You seem agitated. I hope you do not count him
one of the new school. Though he is close to Ikamon,
I will admit.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No; I had another thing in mind. Go on with
your talk. The mood is a modest one.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I&#146;ll trust you, though it were better a man kept
his own counsel.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Daikomitsu? Ha, ha; how egotistical!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And you really love me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you hate me.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What chance is there between hate and love?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is there that I would trust a woman.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu was pleased to have an opportunity to
unfold his plans to somebody, and no one seemed to
have more patience than Takara. Even her willingness
seemed an encouragement to him. It did not
count that she used him as a means of escape from
others, for he had grown up in the same easy atmosphere
and loved her from early boyhood. He always
would love her. It mattered not that she had
been married to another or that she might marry still
others, he should love her just the same. Time
might have wrought its changes, but not the even
tenor of Daikomitsu&#146;s way.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
Portly and of average height, his face smooth-shaved
and head somewhat bald, a goodly measure of
royal blood coursed in his veins, and he was accounted
a prince of high rank. Being a devotee of that classic
school which grew up around Nara, and an ardent
supporter of letters, he had gained a high standing
as a scholar, though his learning was hardly profound
nor his manner entirely polished. He had never been
accredited with anything like ability or ambition,
and therefore was not courted much at home nor
taken too seriously elsewhere. However, in this they
were all destined to a severe awakening; for until
now Daikomitsu had only once been really stirred,
and that was by the sudden marriage of Takara. He
had kept his counsel well, but from that time forth
he had an ambition. Just what it might be he did
not himself quite know; still he had determined upon
something, and with one so high in the councils of
state it required only time and opportunity. The
occasion must come, and he was perfectly willing to
drift and wait.</p>

<p class="indent">Not caring much for the effeminate pastimes of the
plethoric supernumeraries at Kyoto, nor being required
much at council, he was at liberty to go and
come as best pleased him; therefore shortly after
Takara&#146;s removal to Tokyo he, too, sought the shogun&#146;s
capital. He probably did this as a natural consequence
more than as a fixed plan to be near Takara;
at all events he did not disturb her, and his visits
were always within the bounds of strict decorum.
She, on the other hand, had paid but little attention
to his coming and going, treating him as she did all
others who were friendly at the lord daimyo&#146;s castle.</p>

<p class="indent">Later, after going to live at Tetsutaisho&#146;s house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
Takara saw but little of Daikomitsu, meeting him only
occasionally at Maido&#146;s, where they were both wont to
go and visit at odd times. While Daikomitsu knew of
Takara&#146;s abandonment of her own home for that of
her brother-in-law he did not divine the true extent
of her relations, though much of the gossip reaching
Kyoto&#151;finally resulting in her strange return&#151;did
so through the medium of none other than himself.
And when she had gone he too returned, though
no one ever accused him of having any direct connection
with her removal.</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu had through all these years grown to
be popular at the capital and considered a good friend
at court&#151;even accredited by some as being in sympathy
with the shogun&#146;s cause. Especially the opposition
to Ikamon courted his favour and even many
of the latter&#146;s staunchest supporters admired him.
In fact his influence had already come to be felt, and
he had not a little to do with prolonging peace and
maintaining order between the two rival factions, the
north and the south. In consequence he interested
himself to know whether the geisha party had been
given to cover some breach between Maido and Ikamon,
and whether the lord daimyo&#146;s removal to the
country had a political meaning deeper than appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Tokyo he did not believe to be the place to gain
such information, and hastening back to Kyoto he
began making himself a friendly caller at the Kanazawa
castle, though he did not associate himself
much with the quiet meetings that were beginning to
be held there to discuss public affairs. He may have
been too sagacious for that, even though thought to
be slow and of small consequence.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was he in harmony with the sentiment so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
rapidly centring around Maido. He had lost none
of his sympathies for the mikado, still he did not believe
that any improvement could be brought about
by the admittance of foreigners into the land; and on
that point thoroughly accorded with the mikado
himself, as well as with Saigo and Kido and all the
leaders of the dominant faction in the south. Realising
the dangers of personal alliance, Daikomitsu held
himself as much as possible aloof from all doings, and
contented himself with investigating the real status
of affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">His correct understanding of the political situation,
while not generally known, had been due in no small
measure to his relations with Takara. The return of
Shibusawa to Kanazawa had aroused her interest,
and stimulated her to take a more active part in the
affairs of life. In fact she had even gone so far as to
delve into politics, and whatever Takara did she did
with an energy. Thus she not only continued her
indifferent relations with Daikomitsu, but actually
sought to open, upon the same terms, some sort
of intercourse with the house of Maido, including
her own husband, Shibusawa.</p>

<p class="indent">Until now she had taken no particular notice of his
return from abroad. She had always held considerable
regard for her husband, though in her own heart
she felt there never could be anything of family interest
between them. It might have been intrigue,
but it could not have been love that now prompted
her to seek him.</p>

<p class="indent">While Daikomitsu did not know so much&#151;Takara
had not taken the pains to tell him anything&#151;he
was not jealous of Shibusawa. He had never been
jealous of anybody, and only dreaded their coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
together again as being the possible means of her
total loss to him; he planned accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I shall be going to Tokyo in a few days, Takara,
and I trust upon my return your heart will not have
gone in Shibusawa&#146;s direction.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Foolish boy! You might sooner expect it yourself.
However, I am going to invite them over, and
I shall want you to carry the message.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And serve you at the door?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, no; I shall for that excuse you; it is the
daimyos&#146; call, not the princes&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And when do you expect such a gathering?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Not later than Tenno-Sai. It is a good time.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I would return even before that, should you wish
it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You are always kind, Daikomitsu.&#148;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br/>
THE DAIMYO&#146;S ARREST</h2>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu proceeded directly to Tokyo, and
upon his arrival found the shogun&#146;s party considerably
stirred up over what threatened to become
a serious breach. It had been strongly hinted by
some of Ikamon&#146;s enemies that the lord daimyo of
Kanazawa had withdrawn in disgust, and for no other
reason than a hearty dislike of his son-in-law&#146;s encouragement
of everything foreign. There was also
gaining ground a feeling that the crafty minister had
used too much to his own advantage the powers of the
shogun. Notwithstanding this latter charge, the
real cause for dissension centred in the growing distrust
of the foreigners. Here as in Kyoto it had already
become the main issue, and strong overtures
were being made to some of the leaders in the mikado&#146;s
ranks for a coalition of all the anti-foreign forces.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon Daikomitsu&#146;s return to the scene at Tokyo
he was showered with every consideration. In fact
some of the more ardent openly stated that he had
come as the secret envoy of the mikado, for the express
purpose of encouraging a friendly understanding between
the two heads of government on that subject.</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon was not at all pleased with these friendly
demonstrations, because things had so shaped themselves
that he could not recede from the position
taken had he so desired or thought best. He had
used his influence with the shogunate to stamp approval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
only upon such foreign measures as he had
been forced to concede, rather than involve the nation
in open hostilities with the powers; which he
knew full well would have been practical suicide. As
a result of these several contentions there had sprung
up, among a few of the more radical of the prime minister&#146;s
foes, a demand for the regency of Hitotsubashi,
and whisperings of Daikomitsu as a possible successor
to Ikamon himself. It had already come to Ikamon&#146;s
ears that even Tetsutaisho had listened to the
rumors with indifference, whereupon the prime minister
sought an interview with Daikomitsu and undertook
to wrest from him a definite understanding.
The easy-going scholar, of course, denied any such
thought as disloyalty to a friend, and carelessly went
so far as to suggest stringent measures.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;This unrest must be checked in some way,&#148; said
he to Ikamon, a day or so before he had fully made
up his mind to return to Kyoto. &#147;Why, it is rumoured
that even Maido is in some way dissatisfied.
Yet I should sooner think it his son, Shibusawa, were
he in a position to speak.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will admit a drag-net might surprise the most
sanguine these days&#151;still, Maido is beyond question.
When he has proven false, then it is high time
for such as you and I to indulge a quicker spirit. In
the meantime let us not abstain too much from the
liquor&#151;this the golden wine that kissed the wood
these forty years or more&#151;and here is to &#145;longer
friendship&#146;,&#148; said Ikamon, as he raised the bowl to
his own lips, then passed it to his guest.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And a &#145;better understanding&#146;,&#148; answered Daikomitsu,
as he emptied the contents and filled again
the cup for his host.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
After this last interview Daikomitsu concluded he
had best get away from the scene of his rising popularity,
so he immediately returned to Kyoto, where
he found Takara anxiously engaged about the daimyos&#146;
meeting, which had already been planned. She
had talked with Kido and others, and according to her
version none had seemed to object and all promised
to take part in the proceedings. Just what the plans
really were, no one claimed to know or greatly care;
nor did she herself apparently have a very clear
understanding. It was her maiden effort in politics,
and she knew only that something must be done.
Perhaps she had been advised by Kido, who was pre-eminently
qualified and probably not reluctant. Possibly
she took a woman&#146;s course, and put in motion
all her forces at the first impulse. However that
may have been, the call was duly made and all responded.
Daikomitsu had in person carried the invitation
to Maido, and to make certain his response
remained there until proper to go.</p>

<p class="indent">After the daimyos had assembled, including all the
southern sympathisers and many from the north, it
soon became apparent that an effort would be made
to pledge a united support to a measure intended to
expel the foreigners.</p>

<p class="indent">Maido had gone there with no intention of joining
any such movement, in fact had never surmised its
proposal; nor did he afterwards discover that he had
really been tricked. Saigo was extremely anxious to
get the tacit if not active support of Kanazawa, and
in consequence had at an early day cautioned Kido
to lose no chance to cultivate a friendly relation with
the lord daimyo. Kido, too, appreciated the benefits
necessarily to result from such a policy, could they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
but secure his friendship, though they failed of an alliance.
Being not only a very wise statesman, but an
adroit politician, Kido recognised Takara&#146;s relation
to Maido&#146;s family and counted the power of woman
in matters of state, had she the aptitude and could
she be induced to venture. Therefore he used the
first opportunity to gratify the mikado&#146;s daughter in
her ambition and thus further their cause; though
the consequences proved to be far more startling than
even he had dared to think.</p>

<p class="indent">The reception accorded the lord daimyo upon his
arrival at Kyoto pleased him very much, and he felt
glad indeed for an opportunity to visit his daughter-in-law.
While living at his house in Tokyo she had
endeared herself to him, and though he realised Shibusawa&#146;s
indifference he may have had some hope
that this visit might result in at least a partial reconciliation.
He knew that originally the marriage had
been a sad mistake, but somehow began to feel that
possibly in the end it might resolve itself into a useful
if not a happy union. He had finally responded
to the invitation with such a thought uppermost in his
mind, and without paying any attention to the daimyos&#146;
meeting sought while there to devote himself
to Takara.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, he had been present only at the passage of
one measure; and then was so engaged by Daikomitsu,
who accompanied him and had induced him to attend,
that he gained little understanding of what actually
took place. Nor did he take a copy of the document,
when the final draft was submitted to him, but allowed
his supposed friend the privilege, eagerly taken, of
placing it hastily in his girdle; afterwards striding off
pleasantly, together, toward Takara&#146;s house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&#147;It is a capital idea,&#148; said the younger man, as
they approached the marble doorstep. &#147;I want to
have you entertain a more friendly feeling toward our
people, if not our cause.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am at peace with all the world,&#148; answered
Maido, heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then we are already on friendly terms.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I trust so.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And there is a reason.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Maido never betrayed a friend.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Nor formed a friendship in vain.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">They had seated themselves in the guests&#146; hall, at
Takara&#146;s invitation, and were enjoying their pipes
and tobacco. Neither had spoken a word to break
the silence for some time, when suddenly Maido said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The document, Daikomitsu. Let us see what
these lords and barons have been up to.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Oh, some letter of the mikado&#146;s, I believe,&#148; said
Daikomitsu, unconcernedly, though he trembled
perceptibly as he drew it from his girdle and tossed it
toward his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Some friendly encouragement, I presume.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes, in relation to the foreigners, I believe.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Of course,&#148; said the elder, as he drew a long whiff
and sat blowing the smoke through his nostrils.</p>

<p class="indent">The lord daimyo paid no heed to the&#151;as he supposed
innocent&#151;document which lay at his side,
but continued the conversation as if he preferred
more to hear his friend&#146;s explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Takara came in and seated herself at her
father-in-law&#146;s side. Thereat the subject of conversation
changed and Maido picked up the dainty roll
of paper and tossing it at Takara told her to take
care of it until he should want it. She caught it and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
after a while, when the men were occupied, carelessly
unrolled it, and read from beginning to end. As she
did this Daikomitsu watched her closely; he twitched
nervously and coloured noticeably, though taking care
not to attract Maido&#146;s attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara read on without observing either of her
audience, and when finished smiled with a sense of
satisfaction. Then re-rolling the paper and replacing
the dainty silk which held it, she tucked it away
in the sleeve of her kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">The measure in question was nothing more than the
endorsement of a letter which purported to have been
written by the mikado, addressed to the daimyos
there assembled, individually and collectively. The
endorsement was in the nature of a resolution passed
in open assembly, only by the assent of the daimyos;
a copy of the letter and resolution, bearing all their
names, having been handed to each, his silence being
deemed a sufficient approval. The letter recommended
that they consult with certain leaders of the
bakufu, at Tokyo and elsewhere, named therein at
the instance of Daikomitsu, and that they organise
a movement to drive out the foreigners and thereby
satisfy the demands of the people and restore peace
in the land. As a precaution against being found
out by the powers at Tokyo, no extra copies were
issued, and none not liable, excepting only Daikomitsu,
had been allowed to be present.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara and her company continued to sit until
presently the conversation drifted to things of interest
about her home life; whereupon she proposed they
stroll through the gardens and enjoy the early cherry
blossoms. To this the men agreed, and she courtesied
and retired to her own apartments to make ready for
the walk.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
Entering her own chamber Takara took the document
from her sleeve and hastily placing it in a lacquered
chest carelessly dropped the lid with a loud
report. Turning quickly around, she observed that
she had not closed after her the partitions and that
Daikomitsu could have seen her, though he had turned
his face and was not then looking. Closing her room
she proceeded with her toilet, soon after joining again
the party, all of whom strolled out into the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">They had not been there long, however, before
Daikomitsu excused himself and went away, failing
to come back again; and when Takara returned to her
room she did not remember to look for the paper
which she had secreted in her toilet case. In fact, it
had entirely escaped her, and she also failed to think
of it when Maido later on prepared to take his departure;
nor did she afterwards call it to mind, until too
late.</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu had watched her, and from the closing
of the lid knew just where to look for the copy of the
letter and resolution; and upon excusing himself in
the garden, stole to her room, and taking the instrument
gave it to a waiting messenger, who bore it
directly to Ikamon. It proved to be Daikomitsu&#146;s
golden opportunity, and he grasped it eagerly and
effectively. He had in one act proved his loyalty
to Ikamon and laid open the way to success, for
which he had become eager and in his own easy way
sagacious.</p>

<p class="indent">Such a sweeping disclosure as this purported to be,
though Ikamon had had a thorough understanding
with Daikomitsu before the latter&#146;s departure for
Kyoto, could hardly have been so soon expected. The
prime minister&#146;s self-constituted spy had promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
something interesting; but that he should forthwith
be able to return an official document implicating
so large a number of powerful daimyos&#151;including
his own father-in-law and nearly thirty of the bakufu
of his own city&#151;in a plot that threatened his own
safety and endangered the shogunate, was beyond
his comprehension. At first he was dumfoundered,
but having fought his way thus far he did not propose
to be outwitted. So he pondered the situation
over night and the next morning called Jigokumon,
keeper of the torments, and questioned him about
the capacity of the dungeons. Then he said to him:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Make ready the cellar of torture, and see to it
that the slow fires are well kindled and the red light
plentiful, and that the sulphur pots are all filled
afresh. Be careful lest there be one among your
lackeys who betrays you, for Jigokumon shall suffer
the consequences.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he began preparing a list of the condemned;
taking particular pains to include all of the bakufu
whose names appeared in the letter supplied through
Daikomitsu, and as many of the daimyos as he thought
it practicable to arrest without warlike resistance.
In all there were thirty daimyos and twenty-seven
bakufu. For these he issued a warrant in the name
of the shogun, commanding the officer of the guard
forthwith to bring their bodies before the law, that
they might be judged as to their disloyalty, the crime
charged. Having duly issued and delivered the writ,
his reflections grew, until finally the enormity of the
situation had so fixed itself upon his susceptive nature
that no punishment seemed severe enough to fit the
case.</p>

<p class="indent">At first he inclined toward excusing Maido, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
upon reflection changed his mind and left his name
upon the list; and as time went on and he dwelt upon
the matter he conjured up the most hearty distrust
of his father-in-law, and finally in his own mind ranked
him the most dangerous enemy of them all. He said
to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I can now understand why the daimyo wished to
withdraw from the capital. How I was led into letting
him go! A swifter vengeance could not have
been less deserved.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The quickness of Ikamon&#146;s discovery of the plot
and the suddenness with which he acted so startled
them and overcame opposition that not one escaped;
but all were promptly arrested and thrown into Ikamon&#146;s
dungeon, where they remained stunned and
overwhelmed, awaiting their doom. Probably the
most heart-broken and puzzled of the many was
Maido, for he had no inkling of such a thing and certainly
knew of no reason why he should be so treated;
though high-handed proceedings were not at all uncommon
even in that late day.</p>

<p class="indent">At first he inclined toward treating the whole
matter as a joke, and finally upon his departure told
Shibusawa that he should not remain a martyr, but
would return a Maido.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I trust so,&#148; said the doubtful son, as they saluted
a last farewell and the father started off, all fettered
and bound.</p>

<p class="indent">Maido did not deign to think that anything more
than some trivial misunderstanding had arisen, and
that upon his arrival at Tokyo everything would be
satisfactorily explained and he would be accounted
the abused rather than condemned as accused. Shibusawa
had less confidence in Ikamon and was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
doubtful, still he did not believe anything serious
would come of it, otherwise he would have resisted
the arrest. In talking the matter over with his son,
before being carried away, Maido recalled the fact of
having left with Takara the only bit of evidence he
had received of his participation in the daimyos&#146;
meeting. He remembered having given her the document
after talking it over with Daikomitsu, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I will ask for it, and Takara will send it forthwith
to Tokyo. It sets forth all that to which I am
a party, and will be a complete vindication. Daikomitsu
knows its contents, and it could not be in safer
hands than Takara&#146;s.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I do not too much like Daikomitsu,&#148; said Shibusawa
anxiously. &#147;He is profuse, and has a purpose.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Even so, Takara can be trusted. Do you know,
I believe my presence was desired more by her than
the mikado? And really she is a grand woman. I
trust you will know more of her, and it is my hope
that you may like her better. She desires it, I fancy.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">After Maido&#146;s departure, Shibusawa recalled the
circumstance and felt much annoyed at the part
Daikomitsu had played in connection with his father&#146;s
presence at Kyoto. He had come to know his wife&#146;s
former lover very well from his repeated visits to
Kanazawa in the winter, and was not much impressed
with his sincerity. He had also gathered the impression
that the apparent dullard had far greater ambitions
than generally accredited, and felt suspicious of the
close relation that seemed still to exist between
Daikomitsu and Takara.</p>

<p class="indent">In his limited acquaintance with his wife Shibusawa
had formed the impression that she was rather a
clever woman, and now that she too appeared recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
to have taken much interest in Maido, and
gained possession of his only evidence of vindication,
he could not resist connecting the two and believing
them implicated in some plot to embarrass his aged
father, if not to be rid of him entirely. He did not
like the look of the situation, and the more he studied
the darker it grew.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br/>
MAIDO&#146;S PENALTY</h2>

<p class="indent">As the time passed and no word came from his
father Shibusawa began to realise the full force
of his presentiments. He had not the power to go to
his parent&#146;s relief, and his only hope lay in his ability
to guard against still further and greater disaster to
the family. He fully realised his responsibility, and
undertook to acquit himself with due respect to the
inevitable and a proper regard for truth.</p>

<p class="indent">The aged daimyo had stood patiently the journey
and borne up well under the charge until reaching the
Tokyo dungeon, into which he was thrust without
even a chance to meet his accusers, much less any opportunity
to hear or explain.</p>

<p class="indent">The foul place which held him prisoner lay in a
damp, dark hole in the cellar, underneath the very
building in which his son-in-law swayed the sceptre of
his vast power; and though many of these gruesome
cells, each holding its captive, they were so constructed,
with huge walls and peephole grates, that
no person could be seen or a voice heard from one to
the other. Not a rat or uncanny thing could get in
there, nor was there room to lie down on the cold,
hard tramped floor. As Maido entered his last hope
vanished; he knew too well his doom. He could not
eat the miserable food each day silently pushed in at
the bare opening high up in the narrow door, nor
could he sleep, but sank down and prayed. He
asked his god only that his son escape.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
With Maido thus caged below, Ikamon busied
himself above; he believed in doing the thing once he
had made up his mind. The consequences could and
would better adjust themselves afterwards. He had
made his way by bold and unflinching strokes, and
he reasoned that a change of policy now would certainly
bring, if it did not merit, disaster; therefore he
hastened the trial, and concluded the testimony after
the first ordeal.</p>

<p class="indent">The morning came on gloomy, and a murky atmosphere
hung over the city like a pall. Ikamon rose
early and hurried to his great seat in the hall of state;
then hastily donned the gown of justice and took up
the cudgel of vengeance. There was no one to dispute
his right, no one to stay the hand which had now
turned to fiend, and he fiercely called out:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Jigokumon!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sayo, most honourable high minister,&#148; answered
the doughty keeper as he came trudging forward,
bowing and attesting.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Have the prisoners confessed?&#148; asked the mighty,
speaking purposely in the plural.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No; your most honourable perfectness, they have
not had&#151;they have not.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then proceed with the ordeal; the court cannot
be so trifled with.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The tormentor withdrew. He knew where to begin
his awful work, for Ikamon had long before told
him that, and cautioned him about the victims. He
groped his way below and fumbled at the keyhole.
The great iron lock creaked as he threw back the rusty
bolt. He hauled and shoved at the grimy door, and
the filthy den belched its nasty air. Two vile lubbers
fell upon the faint and helpless daimyo, roughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
dragging him out. He made no resistance, nor did
he cry aloud. They hurried him through the long,
dark, narrow passage to a muffled exit. The door
closed behind them, and Jigokumon thrust a lighted
torch in Maido&#146;s face, and snarled:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What now, you hinin?&#148;[<a href="#index19">19</a><a name="fn19" id="fn19"></a>]</p>

<p class="indent">Maido did not speak; he was beyond that. The
light blinded him and terror overcame him. He
glanced pitifully at Ikamon&#146;s ruffians, then sank
back unable to comprehend. His torturer sneered
as he snuffed the light and hissed:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To the torments!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Throwing open the outer, or last door, the two
flunkeys thrust the lord daimyo forward upon the hot
cinders covering the earthen floor. Jigokumon remained
outside; it was too awful in there, even for
him. They hustled Maido to the centre of the room
and lashed his hands at his back with one end of a
cord which hung loosely from a beam overhead.
After securely tying his feet together the two heavy
men slowly pulled at the loose end of the cord from
above; whereat the victim&#146;s arms fairly twisted in
the sockets and, with downcast face, his limbs hung
limp. Maido groaned, then nerved himself to the
ordeal.</p>

<p class="indent">Having raised him a trifle from the ground, the
monsters slid beneath his bare feet a pot of burning
coals from which the lid was stripped. The sulphur
pots were lit, and the red light flashed&#151;the fiends
disappeared, and the fumes rose, enveloping the
suffering patriot. He uttered no sound, but looked
upon the hellish scene with stoic indifference. Perhaps
he thought of man&#146;s sphere as compared with
God&#146;s. Possibly he contrasted the good with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
evil of life, as lived on earth; and he may have
glimpsed at a truer way, the one that heaven foretells.</p>

<p class="indent">He had hung there only a few minutes&#151;it seemed
to him an age&#151;before his feet shrivelled and blackened,
while the fire crackled and sizzled around them.
As his contorted body dangled in the air, his face upturned,
he momentarily saw, peering through a glass-covered
peephole, his trusted son-in-law, Ikamon; then
a smile crossed his face and he lost all consciousness.</p>

<p class="indent">While Maido was being pushed into the cellar of
torture, Ikamon had seated himself in the judge&#146;s
cubby-hole, which adjoined the chamber of testimony,
permitting a close watch of the victim and a
taking of the confession, if such were made, without
suffering the annoyance of the fiery fumes within. He
looked only once, and fate revealed the sickly smile,
whereat he quickly drew the curtain, and turning,
shouted:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Jigokumon; Jigokumon; relieve the victim; the
confession is made!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the fires were extinguished, and Maido,
more dead than alive, was restored to the damp cell
from which he had been taken. He did not recover
consciousness for a long time, but when he had done so
he suffered such intense pain that he begged the dumb
walls for death.</p>

<p class="indent">He had, however, long to wait, for he had been left
there to suffer all but that. Ikamon, though, gauged
well the time, and before too late pronounced the sentence:
Maido, together with all the rest, was led forth
into the wilderness of Musashijamoku, where they
were scattered about and permitted, one after another,
the right of harakiri. There overhung the
marsh land a mist, and the murky wet clung to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
smooth, round bamboos, echoing a grave-like sound
as each pronounced the parting word. All excepting
Maido had gone, and it now came his turn. He sat
there in the cold wet with his snarled and decaying
limbs crossed under him. His face was upturned
and in his right hand he held the sharpened steel. He
had thanked his accusers for respecting his right to
die as became his rank, and now thought only of his
own, his son. Out of the gloom of the swamp there
arose the sound of the executioner&#146;s voice; it said
only:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Maido.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The blow was struck, and his head dropped forward.
Then there came from the still forest a silent,
anxious step, and trembling voice, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is too late! He is gone!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She bent over him and whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is I.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He raised his face to hers and answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Takara!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It was not I! Oh, honourable father, it was not
I that did it!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Maido said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I understand. It was he who stole it. You are
my deliverer. You have brought me news.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And he knows not your fate, but is not deceived.
He lives and I am still his wife. Shibusawa will
vindicate his father&#146;s name. I swear it!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Takara straightened up and the fire flashed from
her eyes, as her words pierced the dull air around her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is well.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">These were the words with which Maido bade the
world a last farewell, with which he forgave his traducers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
and with which he welcomed death. He
knew Takara&#146;s power and believed in her sincerity.
He was ready to die.</p>

<p class="indent">Maido fell face downward, and Takara bathed her
handkerchief in the blood that flowed from the wound
at his waist; then wrapping up the stained symbol,
hid it in the folds of her obi;[<a href="#index20">20</a><a name="fn20" id="fn20"></a>] she had taken the oath
that is&#151;until avenged.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara stood there as if held by some wild, untrained
spirit; she stared this way and that, then a
low cry escaped her lips. The haunted woods around
mocked her, and trembling she listened. Not until
now had she realised the awful situation or divined
the peril of her strange adventure. She turned to go,
but a rough officer seized and quickly led her away.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon learning of the wholesale arrests, as they
were being made, Takara had missed from its place
of keeping the document which Maido had intrusted
to her care. She recalled Daikomitsu&#146;s nervousness
at the time of her reading it, his chance of seeing her
hide it away, and his sudden departure from the garden,
and thought of his strange actions afterwards;
then she concluded&#151;not reasoned&#151;that these
peculiar circumstances bore some connection with
the unexpected seizure of so many of the daimyos
who were present at the meeting. No one knew
Daikomitsu better than Takara, and while she believed
him a coward of little consequence she considered
him capable of the meanest villainy&#151;in the
prospect of gain without detection. She did not stop
to inquire about a motive, though she might have discovered
one lurking between his repeated trips to
Tokyo and the few unguarded disclosures made to
her in the course of their long acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
Divining the clue to Ikamon&#146;s source of information
the mikado&#146;s daughter had set out post-haste to
frustrate his designs. She first called upon Kido, but
he proved to be powerless, in fact was only too glad
to have escaped. Then she went to Kanazawa, and
there was horrified to learn that her beloved father-in-law
too had been snatched away. She did not stop
to right herself with Shibusawa, who now charged her
with being the accomplice of Daikomitsu&#151;the one
person more than any other interested in the downfall
of the house of Maido&#151;and when he finally
dismissed her, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;There is now nothing to merit even our friendship,&#148;
she stooped with sorrow and answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is true. I am justly served.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Though their meeting had been a pitiful one, Takara
did not break down under the weight of his
accusation nor did she weaken in her purpose. She
had discovered still greater reason for her activities,
and incidentally learned that Shibusawa was fully
prepared to withstand any further assault upon his
stronghold. She, therefore, left him and resumed
her journeying toward Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">At her arrival there the whole populace seemed in an
uproar, the excited mobs everywhere crying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To the swamp! to the wilderness! The yamabushi![<a href="#index21">21</a><a name="fn21" id="fn21"></a>]
the vile! the disloyal! Asano! Kurano!
Maido! Let their bodies be ripped!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Takara shuddered when she heard the fierce
rabble, and her heart poured out its measure. Divining
Maido&#146;s last thought, she hastened forward in the
hope of reaching him before too late to deliver the
word that would give him peace before death. Leaving
her carriers at the wood side, she clambered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
through the mire and under the big trees. Time
and again the weird, painful sound grated upon her
ears as one after another of the victims said his last:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sayonari.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She struggled on, not knowing which way to go,
until she had come within hearing of the mysterious
voice of the hidden executioner, who called in rotation
the names of those that were performing the
honoured rite. She stole after him, and upon calling
the name of her lord and master&#146;s father she rushed
ahead in time to greet him with the assurance that
was to him a recompense for all his trials and sorrow.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately Takara did not see the sickening evidence
of his prolonged and terrible suffering; his
abused limbs had sunken into the mire, and she saw
only that he had died the death of honour. And she
felt happy that she had reached him in time, though
Shibusawa knew not that she carried the message.
Maido&#146;s joy rewarded her.</p>

<p class="indent">The luckless woman&#146;s captor rudely hurried her
through the woods, and departing the scene she did
not look back. She made no resistance, but obeyed
the eager fellow&#146;s command; nor did she think much
of the consequences. She tramped along, and as they
went the air grew more stifling. The hot breath of the
forest rose and choked them, and upon reaching the
open they found it there, too, suffocating.</p>

<p class="indent">Continuing toward the city, they presently reached
the outskirts exhausted&#151;the keeper more than
his prisoner&#151;and climbing to the top of a low hill
halted for the night. Here there stood a temple, and
near by a small tea house in which he undertook, because
of his inability to go farther, to hold her captive;
proposing to rest until morning, proceeding then to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
Ikamon&#146;s dungeon, the intended place of her imprisonment.
Having securely lodged the hopeful woman
in a small detached room, the ponderous captor refreshed
himself and lay down in front to keep guard.</p>

<p class="indent">The humbled daughter of a proud royalty had
failed in her mission, yet in that failure fate had revealed
to her the sweetest rite, the consoling of a dying
friend. Maido&#146;s lips had been sealed, but in that
there arose a fresh desire, and had Takara been privileged
to meet the living as she had parted with the
dead, she would gladly have resigned herself to her
doom. The new responsibility made imperative to
her the seemingly hopeless task of again reaching
Shibusawa.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br/>
THE EARTHQUAKE</h2>

<p class="indent">Takara did not give much thought to her imprisonment
or the disposition that might be
made of her; she felt too tired for that, and had no
sooner been left alone than she fell fast asleep. It
was quite different though with Bansuro her keeper.
He rested hardly any, and could think of nothing but
the reward surely to be had for bringing to the high
court a spy of so great consequence; for had he not,
he reasoned, captured her while in the very act of conversing
with the condemned? And would not Ikamon
rejoice?</p>

<p class="indent">Bansuro had not seen Hontone, Takara&#146;s head
carrier and only protector, as he shadowed and
watched them like a sleuth. Not satisfied with his
mistress&#146; having gone into the woods alone, he followed
and watched from a distance her every movement,
and when caged alone in the room at the tea
house he felt her safe for the night. Hontone then
ran away and brought his fellows, and in the dark and
without discovery they planned her rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">They lay in the bushes growing about the old, neglected
temple, with its crumbling beams and weather-cracked
siding, and were within easy reach of the
cosey place where Takara slept a prisoner. Now and
then Hontone would steal near and listen, then return
with the assurance that she yet rested safely.
Presently, as the night darkened, the air grew murky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
and difficult of breathing. It had been intensely
sultry all day, but now there came from everywhere
hollow soundings, and a hushed silence spread over
the earth.</p>

<p class="indent">The carriers crouched down and stared blankly;
not one of them ventured to speak. The suspense
was dreadful and Hontone whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is an earthquake!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they were thrown straight up from the
ground, and then down and up, while a mad rumbling
sounded in their ears. Their senses seemed suddenly
to depart, and they felt as if no certainty of anything
remained. A short, breathless lull followed, and then
there came another great pounding, as if from beneath,
some monster drove at the earth&#146;s crust with
a huge hammer. The beams split, the walls cracked,
and the tiles rattled down from the roofs. Everywhere
the people ran frantic, with dishevelled hair and
glaring eyes. They groped at nothing, and cried
pitifully. The earth rumbled on, and again they were
shocked and thrown from their feet. The ground
gaped, and frightened men tumbled headlong or balanced
at the edge of dark, bottomless crevices.
Thousands fell and their pitiful cries arose from the
mysterious deep or died away with a faint echoing of
its awful uncertainty. The fire flashed up and burned
fiercely among the d&#233;bris of falling walls and thatched
roofs. The cries of the penned-in victims tore their
hearts, and they ran hither and thither, bewildered
and uncertain. And when the cruel, heartless earthquake
had done its frightful work, and there seemed
no chance for greater havoc, there came a roaring and
crashing as if the sea were rolling onward, crushing
and tossing and mangling in its terrible track the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
half-living who had escaped the lesser, if more frightful,
danger. As the tidal wave came on, grinding
and swallowing the earth with gluttonous fury, they
huddled and waited. There was nothing to do, no
hope to cherish, for they knew not a Home beyond.
Their god dwelt where the reason finds its sway, and
faith is but a factor in what we know.</p>

<p class="indent">The mighty wave, rolling inland, tossed upon its
crest the treasures of the deep and threw them high
upon the mountain side. There were whales of the
ocean and ships of the sea hurled a hundred feet above
its level and carried miles from its shore. And when
the waters receded, carrying likewise the things of
the earth, much of the consequences of the terrible disaster
went with them. Nor was it satisfied to wash
away its own rubbish, but it had carried off, forever, secrets
not its own. The dead bodies of Ikamon&#146;s vengeful
thirst, too, had gone; they were no more, and the
tale of their passing lived only in the memory of the few.
The many had a multitude of their own to mourn.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an awful catastrophe, and its victims were
legion. Still Takara had escaped; at the first warning
of the earthquake her keeper had flown&#151;there
was no prisoner penned in Ikamon&#146;s dungeon on
the morrow, nor any report made of the attempt.
After the first shock had passed, Hontone sprang
from his hiding-place and seizing Takara, with his
strong arms threw her upon his back and ran back into
the bushes, where they all clung fast to the roots and
lay prone for their lives. Takara knew her men, and
happily resigned herself to their protection. Nor did
she surrender amiss, for they not only saved her from
the fury of the elements, but on the morrow carried
her forth from the city unmolested and unnoticed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
Several days had passed before they again reached
Kyoto, where Takara rewarded her faithful men, and
sought retirement and that rest which soon restored
her peace of mind, though the great sorrow continued
to weigh heavily upon her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">While Takara had failed of her purpose she felt
that she had done some good, since she had brought
at death some peace to the one who&#151;more than
any other, not excepting her own husband&#151;had in
some measure come to understand her. She knew
that she had done in the past what she believed to be
her part, and now that a new purpose and a larger
life had dawned she resolved to make herself worthy
the trial. Holding her counsel, thenceforth she began
the work with an earnestness and faithfulness that
bespoke her true character.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br/>
THE CHILD&#146;S FATE</h2>

<p class="indent">Though the earthquake had spared no part of
the capital, and devastated equally among the
high and the lowly, the tidal wave did not rise to the
top of the numerous hills spreading over the city.
Thus many were saved, and by some unknown freak
of fate Ikamon remained among them.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did he suffer much regret; for it had been the
certain means of destroying the unsightly evidence of
his dastardly act, as well as an occasion for the distraction
of the public mind. He had been anxious enough
to get rid of his accounted enemies, but did not much
relish the talk about it; and now that the nation had
been inflicted with a great calamity that would distract
their minds, he appeared really glad at heart. The
dead daimyos&#146; succession engaged his attention first,
and hastening to bury the official notification beneath
the excitement of the moment he began on the very
next day to forward letters of advice and condolence.</p>

<p class="indent">The prime minister&#146;s expressions of sorrow, especially
to Shibusawa, were more than profuse; they
were prodigal, and ended by admonishing this young
daimyo to repose in him that implicit confidence
which &#147;it had been the good fortune of his happy
father before him to possess.&#148; He cautioned him to
look well to the shogun&#146;s procedures, and speed the
day of his coming to Tokyo to prostrate his person at
the feet of his august highness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
While Ikamon had been so fortunate in escaping
disaster, the same did not prove entirely so with
Tetsutaisho. At his house the first shock occasioned
much excitement, and dire disaster followed
in the wake of the phenomenon. Kinsan had not retired
for the night, but sat trilling and musing in her
chamber. The child in its kimono lay sleeping on the
floor near by, while the warm, sultry air floated in at
the house sides, where the slides had not yet been
closed. The tall trees overhanging her veranda
seemed more shadowless than ever before, and
she peered, as she so often did, into the dark solitude
outside.</p>

<p class="indent">At the first tremor she ran and clasped Sodachinojoi
in her arms; then crouched upon the floor, waiting
with breathless expectation. In a moment&#151;it
seemed an age&#151;Nehachibana flew into the room,
with her hair dishevelled and eyes wild and furtive.
Shrieking and wailing she implored Ninigi, now god
of earth, to forego his quarrel with Sosanoo, and cease
tormenting the good people of Jimmu. Kinsan parleyed
with her to be calm, and come and sit by her
side; but this she would not do, for she now bitterly
hated her whom she thought to be her only rival. She
would not be consoled, and when the second shock
rent the earth beneath them and the house timbers
parted and the heavy tiling fell upon their heads a
ghastly smile crossed her face, and she played and
snapped her fingers, and stole toward the deep, hollow
crater opening beneath the rent in the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">A falling tile had struck Kinsan a blow on the head
and she lay helpless at the edge of the gap in the floor,
held only by her clothing from sliding into the yawning
crevice below. The child was unhurt; it played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
upon the tilted mat, and cooed without a sense of its
own peril. Nehachibana leaned over it, anxious and
breathless. Her eyes flashed and she spoke incoherently,
saying;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shall I end this wicked sorrow?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the mat slipped and the child slid into
the gaping earth, and not a sound arose to tell of its
terrible fate. Nehachibana made no effort to stay
death&#146;s angry claim, but recoiled from it and charged
herself with remorse at having lost the chance to take
revenge with her own hand. Then she braced herself
and with set teeth said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is not too late!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Plunging forward and grappling the listless, helpless
form that lay heavily upon the brink, she tugged
and pushed it almost over, then stopped and weirdly
looked around. There was no one there, but the
thought startled her, and she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No. I can take a better revenge.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Pulling her intended victim away from the dangerous
place, Nehachibana brought water in a dish, and
showered it in her face; then went away, and by the
time she had revived she returned, offering assistance
and nourishment. Many weeks passed before Kinsan
fully recovered, and not until then had she been
told of the fate of Tetsutaisho&#146;s son.</p>

<p class="indent">No one had witnessed the sad scene except Nehachibana,
and she took care to remain silent and undiscovered.
Kinsan took the blame all upon herself and
sorrowed deeply and pined much over the loss. Tetsutaisho
was grief stricken, and for a long time unable
to reconcile himself to his only son&#146;s destruction,
hence became more kindly disposed toward Kinsan
and solicitous for her love. She, however, remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
steadfast and true to herself, seeking in every right
way to serve her master and atone for the great sorrow
that she charged herself with having brought
upon him. The disappointed wife in the meantime
resorted to every artifice within her weakened range
to win Tetsutaisho for herself, and no material change
took place among them until she had fully resolved
that no hope remained.</p>

<p class="indent">Takara had not heard of the disappearance of the
child. In fact, having little means of gaining any
knowledge of him without too great danger to all concerned,
she had long ago ceased to worry about his
fortunes. The past was now more than ever a blank
to her. She devoted herself to the day at hand, untrammelled
by that which had gone before.</p>

<p class="indent">Kido, her friend and counsellor, had called a new
meeting of the daimyos, confining his invitations to
the south and only such others as he knew to be safe.
They had been warned against Daikomitsu by Takara,
and wisely heeded her advice: the mikado&#146;s
cause was a sacred right, and its supporters knew no
such thing as disloyalty; their claims were founded
upon principle and their measures smacked not of the
charlatan. Kido, the recognised &#147;head and pen,&#148;
Saigo, the accredited &#147;heart and sword&#148;&#151;they
planned nobly and stood ready to fight honourably.</p>

<p class="indent">As they had been anxious to secure Maido&#146;s friendship
before, they were hopeful of claiming Shibusawa&#146;s
after the succession, and Takara, bending all her energies
to that end, would gladly have sacrificed home,
position, everything, to secure and advance him at the
mikado&#146;s court. No one knew better than she that
his sympathies were more in accord with their ideals
than with the shogunate&#146;s; and could they but enlist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
him they would be in a position to withstand, if not
overwhelm, the enemy. It became a duty with Takara,
and Shibusawa rose to be her god.</p>

<p class="indent">He on the other hand, knowing himself, and cognisant
of his strength, dared not act so quickly. True,
his faith in the shogunate was rapidly being shattered&#151;not
alone because of his father&#146;s wanton destruction&#151;nor
did bitterness poison him; he could see
beyond vicious revenge. There were at stake the
destinies of a nation, the survival of a civilisation, and
the maintenance of a principle that gave or took the
liberties of mankind. He must first see the right,
then succeed even at the cost of life.</p>

<p class="indent">He still doubted Takara, even, in a measure, after
learning something of her heroic sacrifices. In serving
Maido, she had also served him, told him that his
father had died by an honourable rite, to Shibusawa
not the chiefest, but a high aim. He thanked her
from his heart and promised a blessing, though Daikomitsu
he dismissed as unworthy a hearing. He had
less desire to avenge an act than to right a wrong, and
when the would-be-trickster sought his aid in setting
the ronin to move on what he professed to be a common
enemy, Shibusawa frowned him away, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Please do not encourage the thought, much less
the act.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu, however, not so easily frustrated, had
a purpose of his own, and sought in other ways to
further his schemes, though a tangle ensued where
he least desired. The ronin were his fit instruments,
and knowing their readiness he sought and before the
winter had passed set them well in motion. He not
only had done this, but knew better than others just
how the forces of state were scattered; and carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
his knowledge with him went to Tokyo and there
posed as the wise man from the south, and incidentally,
among the prime minister&#146;s enemies, as a most
likely successor to Ikamon.</p>

<p class="indent">The malcontents offered the means, Ikamon&#146;s
removal the place, and the ronin the instrument,
through which Daikomitsu was to rise and prepare
the way to reach Takara&#146;s heart. Keeping well out
of the way of Shibusawa, who, therefore, gave his
movements no further concern, the apparent dullard
proved equal to the occasion, and along these lines
made the advance.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br/>
RONIN RAIDS</h2>

<p class="indent">Owing to unsettled conditions the ensuing
winter proved most opportune for Daikomitsu
to further his schemes and advance his prospects.
Much dissatisfaction had grown out of Ikamon&#146;s
cold-blooded work, and even his friends were shocked
at his audacity. While he still maintained control
of the shogun&#146;s party, he held them together only with
considerable difficulty, and long before the final blow
came found himself in dire straits for sufficient support,
even the protection of Tetsutaisho.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside of Tokyo his doings were looked upon as
the voice of the shogunate and his acts charged thereto,
while at home a feeling gained ground that the
power must be wrested from his hands and the party
restored to its former status. Many realised that
they could not long stand before the inroads of the
foreigners on the one hand and the cry of the populace
on the other. Ikamon&#146;s friendly concession had
ceased to satisfy the one, and his daring blow failed to
crush the other; his enemies were eager for his downfall,
and Daikomitsu offered the most potent, if not
reasonable solution. Therefore they welcomed him
and winked at his questionable doings.</p>

<p class="indent">After placing himself on friendly terms with the
ronin, Daikomitsu began urging them to greater activity,
and as they had already become eager for
some chance again to make themselves felt they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
only too easily inflamed. Although these strange
bands of marauders held many grievances they advanced
no definite policy, and allied themselves with
no particular party or faction; they had come into
existence through an infraction of the law and lived
and thrived best on disorder. The friendship of one
so high in the councils of state as Daikomitsu they
considered a license as well as an honour; and, listening
earnestly to his counsel, advanced, before spring
had come, afresh upon their terrible raids.</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu kept himself well informed as to their
movements, and long before they had concentrated
upon Tokyo had gone there and begun the rebuilding
of his popularity. Managing to elude his acquaintances
at Kyoto and get away without arousing suspicion
as to his intentions and aspirations even
Takara did not divine his real purposes, and Kido
knew nothing of them and cared less about him. Nor
did his friends, professed or otherwise, in Tokyo know
anything about his connection with the ronin, but
(when they thought of him at all) considered him a
statesman and a patriot, without any direct connection
with any party or faction at either place. They
knew he was of the literati and a kuge by birth, but
counted him equally a friend to the true shogunate.</p>

<p class="indent">All the major wrongs complained of by the ronin
were directly chargeable, as they thought, to the shogunate,
and in consequence their activities began in
that direction. Assuming the disguise of various occupations
many of them gathered at Tokyo, marking
their victims and preparing to make good their own
escape. Regular meetings were held and all movements
directed orderly and with despatch, so that as
a whole they made no mistakes, while each member
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
bound himself by an inviolable oath. They had been
worked up to the belief that Ikamon was responsible
for everything, and lest he should escape, early
marked him as their first victim and awaited only the
word of Daikomitsu, who in due time said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Take the principal first. You can better right the
wrong after the instigator is gone.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Ikamon, with all his spies, remained ignorant of the
plot against him, probably because he considered
Daikomitsu his friend and believed in the crude contrivances
advanced to throw him off his guard; possibly
because of his being beset with a multiplicity of
dangers, for these were to him hard and trying times.
He could trust no one now except Yasuko, his wife,
who had remained loyal to him and proud of his
achievements. She knew not the reason, nor did she
question his motives; she trusted him, and that was
to her enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I shall be home early to-day, Yasuko,&#148; said Ikamon
as he parted, bowing politely to his wife, and
started off on a blustering morning in March to attend
to some official duties which called him outside.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then Yasuko is happy, and will abide here and
look until you come,&#148; said she in answer.</p>

<p class="indent">She did look, for he had never deceived her, as she
knew; and she saw the most frightful thing, and fell
to the floor weeping bitterly. Her husband did not
return; but in passing the Sakurado gate had been set
upon by the ronin, and, without any chance of defence
or escape, beheaded; and his head placed upon a long
pole, carried high in the air, was planted at his door.</p>

<p class="indent">This gruesome sight greeted Yasuko when she
looked out along the roadway where she had so often
watched her husband&#146;s coming and welcomed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
entrance. So swift had been the work of his assailants
that none could offer resistance or interfere until
the deed had been accomplished and the warning
carried into the midst of his own household. There
they staked their trophy high in the air, and departing
made so good their escape that no one knew until a
later day who had done the hideous work.</p>

<p class="indent">The removal of Ikamon proved an effective blow to
his policy, and brought about a speedy reorganisation
of the party. Hitotsubashi&#146;s regency was made certain,
and Daikomitsu with little opposition chosen
prime minister; in fact, the latter had been decided
upon by the former incumbent&#146;s enemies before the
butchery occurred.</p>

<p class="indent">The main opposition, however, came from Tetsutaisho,
though Ikamon&#146;s absence left him illy prepared
to cope with the opposition in the council chamber or
at the lobby. Still he developed sufficient strength
to maintain his own position and wrest from them,
finally, his promotion to commander-in-chief of all
the shogun&#146;s forces. In this he was considered fortunate;
and even he, himself, deemed his place more
secure under the new r&#233;gime than under the old. He
reasoned that it could not have been long before
Ikamon&#146;s downfall would have come from another
source, and in that event he would himself, perhaps,
have been less able to force recognition as a result of
his own strength. He had grown wiser with experience,
and no longer desired particularly to fly at the
tail of another man&#146;s kite. Daikomitsu had early
learned that Tetsutaisho was a friend of the army and
they his main supporters, and of late made every endeavour
to cultivate the popular general&#146;s friendship.
He had always taken pains not to give Tetsutaisho
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
the impression that he himself rivalled the latter&#146;s
brother-in-law; but on the contrary had assumed
such a plausible friendship to both that the liberal-minded
commander never really knew the secret of
the wise man&#146;s success.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet, with all his tolerance, he did not care to trust
the new prime minister too much. He lacked confidence
in his ability and remained not at all sanguine
as to his motives; still he would not let any man&#146;s
preferment stand between him and his shogun&#146;s government.
Loyalty was his watchword, and honour, as
measured by feudal standards, his virtue; neither of
which, from his way of thinking, could possibly be
attained outside of the shogunate.</p>

<p class="indent">Position he had; for wealth he cared not. His
friends he worshipped; to his enemies he gave no
quarter. He lived for the love of living, and believed
the mode made right the result. So far as he knew
his own advancement had come more as a matter of
consequence than as a reward for effort. He considered
himself amenable to established law, and such
a thing as a shogun&#146;s wrong-doing had no place in the
mind of Tetsutaisho.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br/>
THE RISE OF SHIBUSAWA</h2>

<p class="indent">The untimely death of Ikamon caused little
regret, even at Tokyo; no attempt was made to
apprehend his murderers, and Daikomitsu settled
down, satisfied in the enjoyment of his emoluments.
Shibusawa remained without his sphere and Takara
soon ceased to supersede the ease and comfort flowing
from official complaisance. The new policy encouraged
quietude, but lacked stability, and only,
perhaps, Shibusawa fathomed the true cause for
unrest.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet, being unprepared, he could take no part in its
effective solution. Like his father before him he had
held himself aloof as much as possible from the turmoils
of state, devoting his energies to internal security
and improvement; not because of seeking to
shirk his duties, but that he might better prepare himself
for the responsibilities. He knew in his own
heart that from the day Perry&#146;s guns first sounded in
the harbour the foreigner had secured a permanent
foothold, and that with him he had brought a new
life, the introduction of which meant more to them
than all the family quarrels and local measures of all
the centuries that had gone before.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only this, but he saw that in adapting themselves
to the new relations feudalism must go, and
with it there would and should fall some of the evil
tendencies of the day; none disapproved by him more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
than that of class limitation upon marriage. He had
come to believe the home the foundation of all organised
society, and held that as it harmonised the affinities
of life so government should make possible the
highest beauties consistent with universality; and as
time went on repeated confirmations of his views so
strengthened his belief that he began to search for a
means of absorbing as much of the new civilisation
as might be forced upon them, or as should seem
beneficial, without losing in any measure their own
autonomy. Finally he had abandoned all hope in
the shogunate and, in consequence, begun to look
toward the mikadate. It seemed his only natural
alternative; possibly the most logical one.</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu on the other hand found himself more
completely submerged in the shogunate than he at first
anticipated. He had intended to rid himself of the
ronin, but not until their attack upon the foreign legation
at Tokyo did he succeed, emerging with a complete
vindication of his true diplomatic qualities. He
had not only effectually cleared the country of these
desperadoes, but placed himself upon a high pedestal,
and even Tetsutaisho began to admire him, though he
could not fully respect him.</p>

<p class="indent">During the transition stage, lasting from Daikomitsu&#146;s
accession to the death of Komei, Shibusawa had
ample time to prepare for the work himself planned
or by others thrust upon him. These were trying
times; this a patient, energetic, and ambitious people,
and not alone fate, but fortune proved a moving
force behind their destiny. From the first Takara&#146;s
hand had been felt, though Shibusawa knew it not.
She developed among the adherents of the south a
strength that gave her voice in the councils shadowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
the court at Kyoto, and she used it to advance a
single purpose&#151;the only one, as she thought, consistent
with her duties as a wife and her position as a
kuge&#151;furthering the cause of her husband and
building the fortunes of the mikado.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually though unconsciously this influence began
to be felt by Shibusawa, and before he knew it he
had gone so far into national affairs that he needs
must play an important part. Nor did he give himself
solely to political matters, for Kinsan remained
ever before him; and though without possible communication
he loved her constantly and truly. He
saw in her more and more the ideal of existence, the
soul of the universe, the crowning glory of all that is.
He longed for her and had he the power would have
sought her and claimed her and taken her, even though
his former convictions had been true or remained uncontradicted.
Without knowing her sacrifices, something
told him that her heart was true, and he asked
of himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;After all, of what consequence is the flesh?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Taking advantage of a measure enacted early under
Daikomitsu&#146;s incumbency, authorising the daimyos
and princes of the blood to remove their families and
lawful kin from the capital, Shibusawa asked his sister
Yasuko to come to him, and though still mourning
the loss of her husband she accepted the invitation
and proved to be a great consolation to her brother,
they becoming fast and true friends and she a liberal
adviser. In her he found a companionship that
helped him through the many events leading up to his
call to the front, though in no measure did it deter
him from shaping a course toward his high ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">The mikado had taken it upon himself to send an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
embassy to Europe and America to examine and
report conditions, while the shogun had in person
conferred with his highness at Kyoto. The latter
event resolved itself into a proposal by the mikado
that the shogun accompany him on a pilgrimage to
the temple Hachiman at Yamashiro, that he might
deliver his own sword to the mighty war god Ojin,
thus inducing his celestial mightiness to drive out
the &#147;barbarian foreigners&#148;; at which the shogun
somewhat reluctantly expressed his indisposition to
join in such a hazardous undertaking, thereupon retiring
to his own stronghold; never again proposing or
sanctioning a conference with his &#147;heavenly brother-in-power.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly after this, possibly for the purpose of encouraging
a breach between the two courts, several
of the southern daimyos, together with Saigo, Iwakura,
and some other kuge attempted to carry off to
the southward the person of the mikado, and were
prevented in their daring scheme only by the timely
interference of Shibusawa. He had been urged into
taking the step by Takara through the auspices of
Kido, and for the heroism displayed gained high
esteem at Kyoto; the schemers themselves coming
gradually to respect him and Saigo to believe in him.
Henceforth Shibusawa attended their councils and
his voice rose to be felt, while Takara began to worship
him, and used all her energies and influence to
further his friendship with the mikado and raise his
standing in the south.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon after, the Shimonoseki affair once more roused
the country; and the report of the foreign embassy
maddened them. They had returned and said in
substance:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&#147;<i>We</i> are the barbarians!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">In consequence of this, as the mikado remarked,
&#147;foolish report,&#148; the embassy were forthwith reprimanded
and deprived of office; the mikado
declaring:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Diabolical spirits rule in this land of the gods,
intending to do away with customs dear to us. They
must forthwith be driven out.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was he alone in his belief, for before the close
of the season his rabid adherents rallied and defeated
a detachment of the shogun&#146;s army sent against them;
encouraging the mikado to issue the famous edict
against the Christians, whereby more than three
thousand converts fell victims to its bane and were
distributed among the daimyos as slaves at common
labour. Nor were they protected by the shogun nor
greatly mourned by their friends; the dislike of the
foreigners had become so rooted that even the shogunate
seemed a crumbling structure ready to fall at the
first organised assault. The revolt spread; but, at the
call of a new leader, who raised the banner of right
shorn of weakness and purged of the last taint of bigotry
and dark mysticism.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa proved the man of the hour, and he
brought honesty and intelligence to the rally of courage
and patriotism. He arose in his power, put a
check upon blind impulse, and set in motion the
forces that were to start the wheels of progress, to
open the way to a place in the sisterhood of nations.
Addressing a letter to the mikado he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The western foreigners of to-day are different
from those of a former day. They are much more
advanced and powerful; the conflict is an unequal one,
and Japan will be shattered like roofing tile. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
cry that reaches you comes from those who do not
understand; it is a misfortune longer to attempt to
close our doors. Instead let us devote ourselves to
house-building, husbandry, forestry, jurisprudence,
and science, and the benefits derived will more than
offset the loss sustained at the hands of the foreigners.
There is a better way to meet their aggression than by
resort to force, and if your majesty will so permit we
pledge ourselves to serve you, the divine and rightful
ruler of this land.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The letter had its effect, and thenceforth there
were but two parties, both of which tolerated the
foreigner, and with one of which every loyal citizen
must sooner or later cast his fortunes. In the following
autumn Iyemochi died, and Hitotsubashi proclaimed
his successor, began to discharge the offices of
shogun, as the vacillating tool of the strongest triumvirate
that had yet undertaken to rehabilitate the
waning powers of a rapidly fading court.</p>

<p class="indent">Hitotsubashi proved an easy dupe and ready listener
by turns to Daikomitsu, Okotsuba, and Tetsutaisho,
the three ministers who were destined to guide
the fortunes of the tottering shogunate till the last
faint quiver told of its final collapse, while Mutsuhito,
succeeding the deceased mikado, Komie, in the following
spring, began that series of brilliant moves
which welded together the hearts of his people and
secured to him his rightful position as supreme and
undivided ruler of his country. From this time forth
the mikadate were united upon one thing&#151;the
downfall of the shogunate. They had had enough of
dual government, with its intrigues and dangers&#151;if
glorious&#151;and the liberal Mutsuhito pledged himself
to the constitution, by which Shibusawa had proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
the people&#146;s rights, and for which he gave his
undivided support.</p>

<p class="indent">The time had come to strike, and when Shibusawa
proposed in open council that Kido be instructed to
address a letter to Hitotsubashi as shogun, Saigo rose
and asked its purport. Shibusawa answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Advise the shogun to abdicate in favour of the
mikado.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">A stillness settled over the chamber, then a roar of
applause burst forth such as had never before been
heard. The giant Saigo thundered his approval,
white-haired men leaped in the air, and everybody
shouted:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Long live the mikado!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The letter, demanding an immediate answer, forthwith
reached the hands of Daikomitsu, who, startled
with the warning, repaired to the temple of Shiba,
and there prayed to Omikami for light, that he might
not &#147;stumble in the darkness.&#148; Acting upon the
advice of this good goddess he laid the matter before
his associates in the triumvirate, resulting in a division
of opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho was a samurai, and none such ever
dreamed of defeat. A thousand years of feudalism
had well taught them their profession. Continued
success made them believe themselves invincible.
The shogun was their idol and war their deliverance.
Thus the commander-in-chief urged the shogun&#146;s defence,
and would not agree to any other means than
force. He was overruled and a more diplomatic
course proposed, yet he sulked and withheld approval.
Tetsutaisho had assented to Hitotsubashi&#146;s assumption
of the functions of shogun because he believed it
necessary; and he was perfectly willing that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
be held and used as a dupe, but this letter from the
south appeared to be a direct attack upon the shogunate,
and no matter who was shogun he believed it
high time to strike rather than quibble. Daikomitsu
answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A resignation from Hitotsubashi, an incumbent,
can in no manner affect the shogunate, an established
institution. If the people want to continue the one
they will restore the other, besides such an act would
forever put the question out of our way. It would
also confuse and baffle the opposition, thus giving us
time to prepare an effective defence.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But we are prepared,&#148; answered Tetsutaisho.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I doubt it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you distrust the samurai?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What then?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Hitotsubashi.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He has no following.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;He has friends, and we can best insure their support
and the enemies&#146; confusion by advising this resignation.
They dread us more than him.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The opposition has given us a splendid chance,&#148;
interposed Okotsuba.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And we are wasting our opportunities,&#148; answered
Tetsutaisho.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;We have no cause to move; we do not recognise
the combination,&#148; said Daikomitsu.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The resignation will test their purpose. I say let
us send it forthwith,&#148; said Okotsuba, recognising the
force of Daikomitsu&#146;s argument.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I recommend it,&#148; said Daikomitsu, earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I do not approve of it,&#148; answered Tetsutaisho
resolutely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
Upon the theory that his resignation would not in
fact be accepted, Hitotsubashi finally signed the letter
of resignation; whereupon, without any serious dissension,
it was forwarded to Kyoto, and Daikomitsu
felt relieved, though puzzled as to what the next move
would be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br/>
NEHACHIBANA&#146;S REVENGE</h2>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho, not at all pleased with the result
of the conference nor convinced of the wisdom
of Daikomitsu&#146;s diplomacy, had been persuaded
quietly to acquiesce, at least for the time being; and
going home settled down, probably for the first time
in his life, to a calm and deliberate consideration for
the future. Presently he became uneasy and, with
unsettled thoughts, said to himself:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Pshaw! Why this worry? Let others stew and
fuss: I am a soldier, and have a better business at
hand. I shall seek Kinsan and let her sing to me&#151;it
is soothing, and more to the purpose of a gentleman.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He did so, and she impressed him more than ever
with the melody of her song. Probably it was because
of the clear, crisp air of a winter&#146;s night&#146;s inspiration;
more likely it had been a consciousness of
her master&#146;s growing gentleness, or the hope within
that some day her heart would soften and her mind
cease its vigil. Whatever it may have been, she
poured out that lofty sentiment that ever eases a
lonely, earnest soul. She sang sweetly, and the
rising notes wafted out upon the still air, reaching and
piercing another who had grown to hate with the
vengeance and covet with the fury of a maddened
fiend.</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana listened. She could bear it no longer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
and with bated breath and snapping fingers stole
upon them. There in the bright light she saw them,
and stopped as if drunk with envy. He sat with his
face upturned; Kinsan stood at one side, looking far,
far away, and her voice trembled with a pathos that
stayed even her destroyer. Nehachibana crouched,
then sprang at her, shrieking:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Geisha! Adulteress! Murderer!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The sudden fright overcame Kinsan; she ceased
singing, then choked for breath and stood trembling,
with her head drooping; she coloured, then turned
ashen.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho arose and advancing toward his wife
said in a calm voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What do you mean, Nehachibana?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;That joro is the murderer of your child, Sodachinojoi!
I saw it with my own eyes.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Turning upon Kinsan, but without advancing, Tetsutaisho
said harshly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Is this true?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan made no answer, nor did she raise her eyes,
but stood nervously toying with the folds of her obie.
Perhaps she did not hear him, heeded only his neglect.
Why did he not turn to her as he had so often
done, and soothe her with his kind words and shield
her from her accuser? The question burned at her
already aching heart, and no one answered.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho, turning around politely, said to Nehachibana:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Please retire to your own apartment and there
wait my coming. I shall want further to converse
with you this evening. Obey me and go now, will
you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana made no protest, but departed as bidden,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
glancing sidewise at Kinsan; her eyes sparkled,
her lip curled, and she smiled the secret of her heart.
Kinsan neither spoke to her nor pleaded with her, but
looked at Nehachibana with softened eyes, and a
great pity welled up from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">After Nehachibana had left the room Tetsutaisho
approached Kinsan and said with low emphasis:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And this is how you have served your master?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Again she did not answer; it was because she could
not. She only sobbed with a broken heart. Tetsutaisho
clapped his hands and a servant came quickly
toward him.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The guards!&#148; said he; then calmly stood surveying
his victim.</p>

<p class="indent">He had but a short time to wait until they came,
though it served Tetsutaisho to cover well in his
heated memory the last few years. Likely Kinsan
did the same, but hers was a different mood. He did
not ask himself the reason, and consulted only impulse;
he may have let hatred enter his heart, for he
now began to suspect as well as doubt his once upon a
time passing friend, Daikomitsu.</p>

<p class="indent">From the time Daikomitsu first came into official
position at Tokyo he had been a constant if not
wholly welcome guest at Tetsutaisho&#146;s house. From
the beginning he had divined Nehachibana&#146;s master
passion, and always tried as best he could to relieve
her hard distress. He had also observed Kinsan and
cultivated her friendship, not that he loved her, but
because he admired her wonderful gift. He, a patron
of art and lover of the beautiful, quickly appreciated
Kinsan&#146;s powers, and instinctively knew and respected
her virtue. That Nehachibana was entirely wrong in
her attitude toward Kinsan he had been fully convinced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
and long hoped sometime to advise the one
of her false impressions and relieve the other of her
natural predicament. Thus he had become a familiar
visitor, and his attentions were bestowed no less upon
the one than the other. Tetsutaisho had never
frowned upon any of these courtesies, in fact rather
encouraged them, feeling honoured by the prime
minister&#146;s warm attentions. He had, consequently,
upon more than one occasion, freely given Daikomitsu
the loan of Kinsan to sing at entertainments of
high degree; and however vulgar the southern prince
may have been in other ways, and whatever may have
been Tetsutaisho&#146;s conclusions at this late day, the
former&#146;s intercourse with the latter&#146;s family certainly
had been of the purest and most honourable kind.</p>

<p class="indent">By the time the guards had arrived Tetsutaisho had
worked himself up to the proper degree of feeling,
however, and without further ado pointed to Kinsan,
saying in a commanding tone of voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To the dungeon!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">As she was being hurried from the house Tetsutaisho
turned his back upon the one he had so long coveted,
and hastened to his wife, nervously listening to her
clear and unequivocal denunciation. She told him
without a blush how she had come upon Kinsan while
in the act of flinging the sleeping child into the dark
crevice, and how she had suffered through all these
years with fear, and how she had hesitated to disclose
to him her knowledge of the awful deed because she
believed his love for Kinsan would bring a punishment
upon herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You will forgive me, my most honourable husband,
will you not?&#148; said she, calmly and invitingly.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not deign to answer her, though his strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
frame trembled as an ungoverned rage leaped to the
fore and grew within him. For Nehachibana he had
no compassion; nothing but regret. He mourned
his lost son, and waxed hot with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She shall die, and that by the saw!&#148; said he, in a
half-crazed undertone.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, no; give me the chance; I&#146;ll devise a torment!&#148;
said Nehachibana, quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You? And why you?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana stared blankly. She did not comprehend.
She had no answer. He looked at her
and for the first time realised the truth. He knew in
a moment the awful consequences of his life. He
would then have recalled Kinsan, but the loss of his
only son was more than he could bear; without a
thought of further inquiry he believed her guilty; if
not of murder then of unfaithfulness, and according
to his code either gave sufficient cause; her punishment
must follow as the only lawful consequence.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus he parted with Nehachibana without further
denial or assurance, and she felt happy and satisfied
with her revenge; and when Daikomitsu called the
next evening, she made haste to express her delight,
offering no pretence of shielding Kinsan&#146;s wicked fate.
The prime minister was shocked at her lack of feeling,
and listened to her with astonishment; she did not
stop with revelling at Kinsan&#146;s sorrow, but lauded the
infant of whom she knew her husband to be the father,
and flattered herself at the thought of its highborn
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu sat dumfoundered and full of pity
until his informant volunteered to disclose the name
of Sodachinojoi&#146;s mother, then he started and with
frightened voice said:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&#147;Nehachibana! You must cease gabbling.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A-h-!&#148; said she, with a drawled accent.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Promise me that you will never again mention
Takara&#146;s name. Will you do this much for me?&#148;
said he nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">She snapped her fingers fiercely, and without
taking her eyes away said, slowly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I shall not speak her name again.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu knew that her promise would never be
broken, and went his way somewhat relieved, yet
overwhelmed; for he also knew that what she related
as a fact must likewise be true&#151;such an one never
mistaking a truth or breaking a promise, when made
or known. Nor was he alone shocked at the revelation
of Takara&#146;s dreadful secret; he felt equally pained
at Kinsan&#146;s misfortune. The former he would take
time to consider, but the latter he should right at once;
else suffer a great wrong to befall not only her, but
Nehachibana and Tetsutaisho as well.</p>

<p class="indent">On the following day the prime minister sent post-haste
for Tetsutaisho, asking him to come at once to
his house, then approaching him kindly, advised that
he forego so severe a punishment, at least until time
should make its justice certain.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And you would also interfere with our private
affairs? What next may not a gentleman expect?
Pray tell me,&#148; said Tetsutaisho rather sarcastically.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No. I thought possibly the motherhood of this
child might sometime be questioned by a higher
power, and in that case my friend Tetsutaisho might
have serious need for this Kinsan whom he has so
lightly condemned,&#148; said Daikomitsu, in answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then you know as much?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I would rather that you should be the judge.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
&#147;Very well; I shall place her in the stocks. It will
answer my purpose quite as well and, now that I come
to think, it may be a more befitting punishment&#151;and,
also, a convenience to you. You can better
visit her in my back yard, Daikomitsu.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I may do so&#151;to see that Tetsutaisho is as faithful
in granting her that liberty as he has been punctual
in making me the promise.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Tetsutaisho is a man of honour.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I believe it, else I should have sought another
means.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho was not so much mystified at Daikomitsu&#146;s
request as overawed with the apparent threat,
for he knew the prime minister to be a favourite with
the shogun and did not wish just yet to put to a test
their respective strength before that tribunal; and
could easily infer from his words a determination to
go even so far. Nor did he court the idea of exposure,
particularly at Kyoto; by this time knowing
Takara to be quite as anxious as he, and feeling
that he must shield her at any cost. Thus he had
hastily concluded to delay Kinsan&#146;s destruction, and
gratify the law&#146;s permit by meting out a meaner
penalty.</p>

<p class="indent">On the next day, therefore, the frail Kinsan with
downcast eyes and haggard appearance was turned
loose in the back grounds of her master&#146;s dwelling,
there to carry, day and night, through rain or sunshine,
the heavy stocks, clasped about her neck and
weighted upon her tender shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">And there, taunted and alone, she bore her punishment
without a murmur, and sinking exhausted at
night always offered prayers for the one she loved, and
for those whom she believed she had wronged and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
had in charity granted her the privilege of even such an
existence. Having already suffered in her own heart
far more than death, now that the day&#146;s penalty had
been imposed, she felt better able to bear her part;
and was glad for life, though bitter it be, that she
might atone for the wickedness with which she unknowingly
held herself charged.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did she suffer only from the weight of the
stocks, but often felt that she must starve for want of
food, and her mouth parched and tongue swelled, for
by reason of the wide board she could neither feed
herself nor raise water to her lips, though a crystal
stream sparkled and flowed at her feet, where she
would often stand and look until she fell faint, and
almost envied the little birds that came and drank,
then perched upon the plank at her neck and sang
songs to her and hopped about with glee. The sun
shone hot or the storm beat hard upon her; the flies
and gnats pestered her, and often when she could no
longer resist sleep the rats and vermin climbed upon
the wide board, and she would take fright and arouse
to prevent their gnawing at her face. And once,
while exhausted with hunger and faint with thirst,
Nehachibana came up to her and mocked her and
gave her red peppers to eat and threw water at her
feet, then ran away.</p>

<p class="indent">All this Kinsan suffered until about to despair,
when a little friend came to her,&#151;it was the daughter
of Mrs. Lindley the missionary,&#151;after which she had
regular food and drink, and felt thankful, though it was
scant and strangely prepared. The jeers of the children
did not provoke her and she bore all the cruelties
without a protest; and at night the doleful sound of
the massagist&#146;s whistle kept her company&#151;stealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
along the streets, plying his blind, nocturnal trade.
And then she would sleep and dream of the cave up
yonder on the hillside not far away and of the days
when she gave her heart in truth and builded her faith
upon hope alone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br/>
MOBILISING THE SAMURAI</h2>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu took pains to see for himself that
Tetsutaisho had kept his word with reference to
Kinsan&#146;s punishment, then without further attention
devoted himself to the arduous duties rapidly crowding
around him. He felt that Takara&#146;s secret rested
safe for the present, therefore did not worry much
about her, although the knowledge of her failure had
been a severe blow to him. There were other things
needing his attention more than a private affair,
and as he had never been an extremely ardent lover
it did not entail any great sacrifice on his part to put
thoughts of Takara aside and busy himself with
matters more urgent.</p>

<p class="indent">Rumours coming in daily from the south made it
more and more apparent that sooner or later a determined
resistance would be offered to the mandates of
the shogun, no matter who the incumbent or what
the purport of their recent letter might be. Yet the
shogunate had in no wise prepared to meet it, and the
delay hoped for as a result of the frank and unequivocal
resignation of Hitotsubashi was much needed by
Daikomitsu and Okotsuba in making a last heroic
effort to gather and utilise the fragments of their
strength. Tetsutaisho took no active part in these
endeavours, neither did he offer any strong resistance
or disencouragement; nor was his failure at that time
so much felt. He was a fighter, not an organiser;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
still his actions had a bad influence upon the samurai
(which constituted the shogun&#146;s army), as it also embarrassed
the remaining members of the triumvirate
in the use of a free hand and undisturbed purpose.
The feeling of uncertainty arising from his indifference
caused more hindrance than any other, and
Daikomitsu grew puzzled to know just what Tetsutaisho
would do when it came to the final test.</p>

<p class="indent">Both Daikomitsu and Okotsuba knew very well that
the commander-in-chief&#146;s influence with the army
rose above that of any other man, and that without
his leadership the samurai would be hard to hold intact.
Yet they could not think of surrendering
entirely to his careless if not boastful ideas, so they
undertook to make their preparation for war harmonise
with his notions, in so far as it became necessary
in order to hold his support.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter containing the resignation, upon its
arrival at Kyoto, so surprised the leaders of the southern
combination that they forthwith began the reorganisation
of the government upon the lines laid down
at a previous assembly of the daimyos. They felt
that the first step toward a complete rehabilitation
had been successfully effected, though not entirely
secured without having gained the sole and unqualified
possession of the person of the mikado. It had
been a universal custom for the shogun to keep a body
of samurai posted at the gate of the Kyoto palace as
a safeguard to the security of the mikado, and now
that the combination looked upon the latter as their
sole supreme ruler they no longer deemed it safe or
desirable to intrust in any measure his protection to a
guard of the enemy, nor to allow them access to the
palace.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
Hence on the third of January Saigo seized the gates
and dismissed the detachment of samurai there stationed,
while the council issued in the name of the
mikado, an edict abolishing the office of shogun, forbidding
the bakufu entrance to the palace enclosure,
and warning all against interfering in any way with
the royal court or council.</p>

<p class="indent">It came as an unexpected blow to the shogun and
his advisers, thoroughly convincing them that, contrary
to their expectations, Hitotsubashi&#146;s resignation
had been promptly accepted and positively acted
upon. It also disabused the minds of the triumvirate
of any hope of their being recognised by the
combination at Kyoto, and Daikomitsu was forced
to acknowlege that Hitotsubashi&#146;s resignation had
been considered the act of the shogunate: that he as
well as the adherents of the Tokyo court would be
compelled to defend with arms their time-honoured
institution. The last hope of conciliation had been
swept away, and Daikomitsu, if not his associates,
realised that it had come to a battle to the death,
not for the expulsion of the foreigner, but for the
very life of the shogunate itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately upon the mikadate&#146;s closing of the
gates at Kyoto and declaring the shogunate at an
end, the princes Owara and Kii had been despatched
to the shogun with a request that he come to Kyoto,
join the new government, and receive suitable recognition
and position thereunder. The shogun
was weak and unable to decide; he hesitated and
wavered between two counsels, for there now developed
a test of strength between Daikomitsu and
Tetsutaisho.</p>

<p class="indent">As usual, however, it again fell to the lot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
army to determine. Whatever may have been Daikomitsu&#146;s
reasons&#151;whether a recognition of the inevitable
or a desire to obtain the best terms possible,
or whether to rid themselves of the cumbersome
Hitotsubashi&#151;he continued to urge the shogun to
comply with the mikado&#146;s request and go forthwith,
peaceably and unattended by military display, and
submit himself and his friends to the reasonable disposition
of the Kyoto court. Okotsuba, in command
of all the shogun&#146;s navy, gave his hearty support to
Daikomitsu&#146;s proposals, and Hitotsubashi reluctantly
consented, forthwith communicating his intention
to the mikado&#146;s envoy, sending back to Kyoto his
best respects and hearty assurances.</p>

<p class="indent">Hitotsubashi had not gone though, nor was he
to do so until Tetsutaisho&#146;s recommendations had
wrought their influence. This proud samurai had
not been so easily convinced of the wisdom of Daikomitsu&#146;s
policy, and now that he had come to questioning
the latter&#146;s motives he began quietly to break
faith with the triumvirate and to approach the vacillating
shogun directly, urging secretly a counter plan&#151;one
more to his own liking and carrying with it a
greater enthusiasm. He argued:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you give this splendid army, the fleet,
their arms and equipments, into the hands of a weaker
force? Sacrifice all these, the building of centuries,
at the first cry of danger? Surrender your birthright
and defame the gods? They tell you they are
your friends, but I believe them to be foes. They
say they are strong, yet I know they are weak.
They cry the samurai are for peace, though I grant
they are for war. Then why not let this talk of
peace be crowned with war? I say, marshall the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
hosts of Shishi-Fukinjin, and enter the gates of
Kyoto with a force that will sound the warning
of Raiden and spread the havoc of Hoorie.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Can you convince me of the samurai?&#148; asked
Hitotsubashi, with growing enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have only to make the call,&#148; answered the
roused-up commander.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;To-morrow I will hear them at the palace gate,
and if Tetsutaisho be vindicated then Hitotsubashi
shall turn his face toward Bishamon and hearken to
the voice of Ojin. Let it be as it may, and go hence
now, that you fail not then, for the hour is to be nine;
then the march shall begin.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I serve you, my most honourable shogun and
august ruler.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho made short his audience, and went
away with a light heart and glowing purpose. He had
met with his first victory, and now almost regretted
having ever listened to the counsels of Daikomitsu or
having pledged himself to any other or further understanding
than the valiant defence of his shogun. All
this happened on a clear, bright morning while the
air was crisp and frosty. The sun had barely risen,
and Tetsutaisho&#146;s drill served him well in getting the
attention of the shogun long before the brainy prime
minister had thought of quitting his needed slumbers.
Leaving the shogun Tetsutaisho hastened along with
vigorous step and rising purpose to army headquarters,
and there gave the command that was to
send a thrill to the heart of every loyal Japanese&#151;whatever
banner, the shogun&#146;s or the mikado&#146;s, might
be the emblem of his fortunes. To his subordinates
he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You will mobilise and report at the inner palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
gate to-morrow not later than nine o&#146;clock in the
morning.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">No intimation was given of what he expected&#151;they
knew their commander had spoken and that if
any should be delinquent it would be they and not he.
Tetsutaisho gave himself no further concern, but on
the following day took his place at the gate promptly
on time, as did also Hitotsubashi, Okotsuba, and
strangely enough, Daikomitsu.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor were the samurai late in coming, for discipline
had been their life&#146;s teaching and they knew no such
thing as failure. They lined up, the left and right
divisions in double rank on either side of the roadway,
their front resting on the inner gate and their rear
stretching through the outer gate afar into the city
beyond. The soft, light uniforms of the swordsmen
wound round their waists and fell on one side well
down toward the ground. At the other side hung
their black sheaths and polished hilts, while their
bared arms and quick eyes told of their great skill at
the business of war. The spearsmen with their
brown breasts and short skirts, resting lightly upon
their spear handles, lined up at the rear on either side,
their spear points glistening away and beyond the
reach of human eyes. These were men of muscle,
and their bared limbs bespoke a wonderful endurance.</p>

<p class="indent">All together, Tetsutaisho might be proud and Hitotsubashi
enthused with the splendid army of their
valorous defenders. The sun peeped out from behind
a passing cloud, and its rays dazzled and reflected
from a hundred thousand bright sides as the long
lines broke and faced about in double file and their
commander stepped forward to greet them. Bowing
low to his shogun he arose and leaned forward from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
the battlement. He spoke in a clear, ringing voice,
his words being echoed and handed on from man to
man, squad to squad, and host to host to the last
one in line:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Comrades and samurai: Our shogun has been
assailed, and your commander&#146;s honour is at stake.
Do you follow me?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The answer came thundering back:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Until death!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">There was not a dissenting voice, and even Daikomitsu
marvelled at their unison of purpose and offered
not a breath of protest. The shogun mounted his
war chair, and Tetsutaisho marched out at the head
of the heart and flower of feudalistic Japan. The war
god had whispered sweetly the glories of victory, and
Hitotsubashi had listened. He drank of the poisoned
waters, and became drunk with desire. He had again
changed his mind, and Daikomitsu&#146;s counsel was of no
avail; he must go, and his friends suffer the consequences
of his folly.</p>

<p class="indent">They marched out of the city and on toward the
enemy, nothing of importance interrupting their
progress until they had reached Fushima, not far distant
from Kyoto. Here the gates were closed against
them, and Tetsutaisho met face to face his older rival,
Shibusawa.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI<br/>
BATTLE OF FUSHIMA</h2>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa, the young daimyo, was there with
a goodly share of the forces of Kanazawa intrenched
behind formidable walls, and the voice of the
cannon warned Tetsutaisho of the former&#146;s determination
to stand, even at the cost of defeat.</p>

<p class="indent">When the mikado&#146;s envoy returned with Hitotsubashi&#146;s
promise all Kyoto had gone wild. Every
preparation had been made for his gala entrance into
the capital and for his welcome at the mikado&#146;s palace.
A million yens had been set aside to defray the
cost and Saigo sent into the south to marshall a force
wherewithal to meet the shogun&#146;s coming in the
height of gorgeous display. The day had been fixed
upon for Hitotsubashi&#146;s friendly arrival, and no
thought of war entered their minds.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus they found themselves relaxed and unprepared
upon receipt of advance news that the shogun
hastily approached with a powerful army under the
command of the invincible Tetsutaisho, and in consequence
their very existence seemed threatened.
There was no time now to reach Saigo; he had gone
far away into the southland. The force left in front
of the gates at Kyoto formed scarcely a bodyguard,
and at last the combination had been brought face to
face with the perils of active warfare.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet there appeared an alternative, and it was
Takara who advanced its proposal. The council had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
met in closed session, and had now become no less than
a storm of indecision. Shibusawa chanced to be
absent, and Kido, alone and unsupported, was unable
to quell the tumult in a disorganised and frantic
chamber. Amidst this frenzy the doors opened and
the mikado&#146;s daughter entered. A hush came over
them, for never before had a woman dared enter there.
It had been the business of men, and since the days of
Jingo their council remained barred to the presence of
women. They ceased quarrelling and stared intently.
She hastened forward, first addressing Kido, then the
assembly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Honourable chairman, and men of the council,
hold your tongues! There is need of a better work.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Not a voice was raised against her; she had gained
their attention. Kido, only, ventured to speak, asking
her to proceed.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you sit here inert, while the enemy beat
down your doors? Falter in the hour of need? Ignore
the help that is within reach?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;No, no, no!&#148; came from everywhere around her.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Then I implore you to act,&#148; said she, resolutely.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;But who is there? Where is our defence?&#148; said a
voice in front.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Shibusawa!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">A stillness came over them. They had not thought
of him&#151;their minds did not go beyond their own
little sphere. Possibly Kido had thought as deeply,
but the time had not come for him to speak. Takara
had now robbed him of the privilege, and every man
there shouted himself hoarse with applause. It was
thenceforth Shibusawa who could and would save
them; drafting a formal request Takara in the absence
of a dissenting voice was chosen the trusted messenger.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
She lost no time in reaching Shibusawa, nor he in
accepting the responsibilities; and while it may have
taken him longer than Tetsutaisho to mobilise his
forces the distance was short and, once on the ground,
his defences were more quickly intrenched. True,
his force at hand numbered less than one to every ten
of the antagonists&#146;, but they were trained to the use
of a more deadly weapon. Shibusawa had learned
while abroad of the utility of powder and shot, and
from the day of his accession had drilled his men in the
use of modern arms. He had thrown away the sword
and spear, substituting the rifle and bayonet. Close-fitting
breeches replaced the loose and cumbersome
garments of the soldiery, and his men had been recruited
from the masses. They were well fed and
enthusiastic, while their steady nerves and acute
sight enabled them to fire rapidly and accurately.
Nor had he equipped solely with infantry, but laid
in a supply of light artillery&#151;the best of modern make&#151;and
this, as he soon discovered, stood him well in
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon his arrival at Kyoto, Shibusawa learned
from news conveyed by runners that owing to Tetsutaisho&#146;s
rapid approach he did not have time to move
his army as far as Osaka, the intended place of resistance;
therefore he selected Fushima, a walled suburb
of the capital proper, as being the most available
place to make a stand and throw up temporary
defences.</p>

<p class="indent">Here he took possession of the outer gates, through
which the enemy must pass on their march along the
Tokaido[<a href="#index22">22</a><a name="fn22" id="fn22"></a>] toward the palace in the city above. Seizing
upon a long, sloping hillside that lay just inside the
great gate, Shibusawa scattered his infantry throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
its length from the wall below to the hilltop at the
bend above; placing them in hollow squares the better
to pick and fell the advancing swordsmen as they
clambered upon the walls, or to fire upon the straggling
spearsmen who chanced to escape the artillery
and gain the gates. The artillery had been intrenched
also on the hillside, sweeping at a convenient range
either the gate or the Tokaido; still a small reserve
was held behind all, out of sight and within easy
reach.</p>

<p class="indent">All in all Shibusawa could have found no more advantageous
place to pit a modern army against a
large force of samurai. Both he and his men realised
his superior position, and it gave them confidence in
their ability to cope with Tetsutaisho&#146;s overwhelming
numbers. They had no time to wait, though they
were fully prepared when the charge began.</p>

<p class="indent">The infantry stood hidden behind the great wall
which crossed the samurai&#146;s line of march, and the
artillery lay low behind their own breastworks.
Only Shibusawa and his small staff stood in the open
above&#151;they were in no danger&#151;and with field-glass
and time-piece carefully watched and noted the
last proud march of the heart and soul of feudal Japan.
He could not help admiring them; and a feeling of sadness
crept over him as he measured their helpless
destruction.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet he stood there, and on they came. Shibusawa
gave the command, and the roar and boom of the cannon
warned the mighty shogun to halt his march.
Again and again the destructive thing belched its
angry fire in the face of an unfaltering foe: they came
on, and Tetsutaisho&#146;s voice rang out on the still cool
air of morning:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
&#147;Down with the gates; on with the march!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The blunt sound of the battering ram bespoke the
hopeless force which lingered in their hands. The
proud commander, with giant stride and thundering
voice, ran down the lines, urging the last onward rush
of a hitherto victorious host. The samurai broke
file and quickly ranked in line after; Tetsutaisho had
presaged the havoc awaiting a close formation, and
scattering his men sought to scale the walls as well as
batter down the gates.</p>

<p class="indent">Within the huge walls all was silence; after the
first notes of warning had been sounded Shibusawa
ceased firing, and did not again give the order until
the gates had been driven loose and begun to fall.
Then a hundred guns poured shot and shell into the
face of the onrushing spearsmen, and the carnage
wrought at that gate was frightful. The dead piled
high in the roadway, though again and again dragged
from the path of the undaunted oncomers. Nor were
the swordsmen less valiant, for everywhere they
scaled the ramparts and rushed upon the infantry.
Thus before long, Shibusawa had called out his last
reserve, and more feebly repulsed the terrible onsets
that came swifter and faster. Column after column
of his advance had been wiped out, and one position
after another yielded to the enraged enemy; yet
his rear lines and the artillery kept up an incessant
fire. Tetsutaisho&#146;s men fell thick and fast about the
gate and around the walls; the defender&#146;s fire was
deadly, and the cost of each advance appalling.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the battle raged and as yet neither had gained
a victory. The ranks on the mikado&#146;s side were
thinning, and Shibusawa could not determine the
reserve strength of the enemy. The shogun&#146;s advance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
had become maddened at the sight of such
havoc, while the rear grew eager with expectation.
Everywhere they scaled the walls, and a constant
stream, though thinned and scarred, now poured
through the battered gates. Tetsutaisho shouted a
last advance, and the valley below swarmed with his
mighty reserve. They did not halt, nor did they
rush; but came determined and invincible.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa groaned as the tremendous odds revealed
themselves. He looked at his scattering few,
then concentrated them, and cheered them for a last
heroic stand. He had withstood a terrific advance,
and now would resist a final onslaught, even to the
last man. They were there to fight, and did not know
the meaning of surrender; nor would they deign to
retreat.</p>

<p class="indent">The solid columns advanced upon them,&#151;shot and
shell could not check those swarming veterans,&#151;and
the walls no longer offered much resistance. Tetsutaisho
rushed forward; Shibusawa grasped his
sword hilt; his men redoubled the fire and hurried
into line. The crack of the rifle, the roar of the
cannon, mingled to make the scene a cruel, sickening
slaughter. Shibusawa&#146;s little fragment seemed
doomed, and he pressed forward to sacrifice himself
on the altar of courage. Then a hand stretched forth
from out the mists to save him; a shell burst and Tetsutaisho
fell wounded in the distance.</p>

<p class="indent">The fallen hero, however, was quickly snatched up
and carried to the rear, while the fight waxed hotter,
and no sign of disorder appeared. Yet there was one
who sat outside the gate, well shielded behind the
walls; he felt sick with the sights everywhere greeting
him, and as the stricken commander was carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
into his presence he weakened and again changed his
mind: when the victory rested within his grasp Hitotsubashi
gave the order to retreat, and the remnant
of Tetsutaisho&#146;s splendid army ran pell-mell toward
the place whence they came.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did the hesitating shogun stop his flight until
he had again reached Tokyo and securely locked himself
within the gates at the palace. Shibusawa had
been too much surprised and his force too greatly
weakened to cut off the enemy&#146;s retreat or follow up
his own victory; a few straggling remnants were driven
beyond the gory walls and begrimed gates, and there
the successful commander halted, content.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time in the history of their country the
power of the machine over the individual had been
fairly tried and fully demonstrated. A vastly greater
force of valiant men had been held in check for hours
by the quick and accurate firing of a few painless,
heartless, soulless guns; though at a frightful cost and
the most heroic trial they had ever known.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII<br/>
THE TRIUMPHAL ARCH</h2>

<p class="indent">After the battle Shibusawa remained at Fushima
until the dead were buried, the wounded
cared for, and the enemy had gone well out of the
country. Then, after directing some further defences,
upon plans suggested during the engagement, he
busied himself with making preparations for the return
march; which, however, did not begin until
Saigo had arrived with a relief force.</p>

<p class="indent">Receiving the congratulations of the veteran commander,
and bidding each other good-bye, Shibusawa
withdrew and began the march back along the Tokaido
toward the gates of Kyoto. His small army had been
sadly reduced, but they came proudly, as the heroes
of a victorious struggle; and when they had arrived
they met with a scene which they had not expected.
The decorations and festivities intended for the shogun
had been put to quite another use; the crown of
welcome had been turned into an arch of triumph,
and the victorious general passed under, the hero of
the hour. Nor was that all; for upon reaching the
gates he there met face to face the mikado himself.
Such a thing had never been known, and for the first
time in the history of the nation their divine sovereign,
on the 7th day of February, had appeared in public.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa, mindful of time-honoured custom,
prostrated himself at the mikado&#146;s feet, and there received
a blessing and his own promotion. Mutsuhito
spoke in a clear and kindly voice, saying:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
&#147;I declare myself, Mutsuhito, the sole ruler of this
land; and I appoint you, Shibusawa, the commander-in-chief
of all the forces in the nation&#146;s service; and I
promise the constitution at the fall of Tokyo.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Thereupon he handed to Shibusawa a roll bearing
the inscription of a letter, embodying the foregoing
and the written signature of the mikado, the first to
appear in public. After this there were presented to
the newly made commander-in-chief the emblems
of his office, consisting of a brocaded banner and the
sword of justice. These he accepted at the hands of
Kido, whereupon the mikado retired and Shibusawa
proceeded to the discharge of his duties.</p>

<p class="indent">The public appearance of the mikado and the
announcement of his patriotic intentions, though
sudden and unexpected, had not been made without
careful deliberation and a full consciousness of its
ultimate effect. Mutsuhito, fully advised of the situation,
had pledged his whole heart, hand, and life for
the good of his country. From the time of his accession
to the throne he had been a keen observer, and
now that the greatest clash of arms since the destruction
of the Chinese armada, six hundred years before,
had resulted in a complete victory for their side, he
understood the patriotic outburst of approval that
centred around Shibusawa, the supporter of his
cause; and he proposed to strike, like the man that he
was, where he knew the blow would tell most for what
he, too, believed to be right.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa had not anticipated such applause nor
had he expected so great a recognition; he had gone
forth at the first opportunity to do only what he believed
to be an honour and a privilege. He had acted
as his heart told him to act, and the results seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
but the incidents of fortune. He accepted the responsibility
with dignity and no further ambition than to
serve his country and honour the name his fathers
gave.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor was he unmindful of the part Takara had
played in moulding his purpose and building his fortune,
even to winning the crown of success. Yet he
could not return her that love which completes life
and makes it worth the living; he had given it to another
and it was not his to recall. He set himself to
work at a lighter task, and presently the force of his
great ability made itself felt in the complete reorganisation
and equipment of the grandest army that had
ever marched or fought in the flowery kingdom of
Japan.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br/>
SAVING THE ARMADA</h2>

<p class="indent">The news of the victory had spread rapidly, and
by the time Shibusawa reached Kyoto the whole
south was in a state of unrestrained enthusiasm.
From the first days of the shogunate, the south had
never at any time yielded complete submission. They
had always believed in the divine right of the mikado,
and still cherished the hope of his complete restoration.
They had fought many battles before, but
somehow this one sounded a deeper note. A new
leader had risen, and they rallied to his support with
a better heart and bolder purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">While the force of the great success had been thus
encouraging in the south it worked a radically different
effect in the north. The news had travelled faster
than the terrified shogun, and long before he reached
Tokyo they had heard of Tetsutaisho&#146;s misfortune and
of the crushing defeat Hitotsubashi had suffered to
befall the brave samurai.</p>

<p class="indent">On the return march he was openly jeered, and nowhere
did the retreat meet with even respectful consideration.
Everywhere throughout the north the
people bowed down with sorrow; but in their hearts
there arose a feeling of contempt for the halting,
fleeing shogun.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Had Tetsutaisho but escaped disablement!&#148; became
the suppressed cry on every hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Hitotsubashi re-entered his palace a broken-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
man, and there shut himself in, a prisoner and
a failure. It wanted only the bidding of the first
comer to startle and frighten him into a weak and
puerile submission: he waited and the time quickly
came.</p>

<p class="indent">In the readjustment of the army, Shibusawa not
only took advantage of the strong public sentiment
greatly to augment and newly equip the force at
hand, but introduced an entirely new system of
arrangement and discipline. He made of the army
three great divisions: the Central or Home division,
over which he himself retained the immediate command;
the Right or South division, the command of
which he intrusted to Saigo; the Left or North division,
which, strange to say, Tetsutaisho, his most
bitter enemy, was named to command.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa alone was responsible for the arrangement,
which, not at first entirely understood, soon
became generally known and proved most effective
in its workings. Without in any manner weakening
his effective forces he had placed his strongest enemy
in the light of a rebel&#151;than which there is none
more odious in the eyes of his countrymen&#151;and
rather than bear the stigma of being so called many
withdrew their support from the shogunate or came
over entirely to the side of the mikadate.</p>

<p class="indent">While these sweeping changes were in progress,
an expedition was also being planned that should
carry the seat of warfare far to the northward, and
even to the very door of the shogun&#146;s palace itself.
Such a thing had never before been thought possible,
and now, when the most unheard of changes were
the regular order, it was looked upon with wonder.
Still the people, though amazed, had confidence in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
Shibusawa, who carried on his work with a full understanding
of its probable effect at home, as well as its
possibilities in the north. Nor was he unappreciative
of the advisability of following up his first victory
while its consequences were yet fresh in the
minds of all. Hastening his movements as much as
seemed consistent with good judgment, he began
mobilising a vast army near the seashore at Owara,
and there rendezvoused all the ships at his disposal
or that he could buy or build in the meantime.</p>

<p class="indent">So rapidly did Shibusawa move that by the middle
of April he held in readiness a fleet of two thousand
craft of all sorts and an army fully one-half the size
of that which Tetsutaisho had three months before
marched against them. Thereupon he notified Tokyo
that the mikado had proclaimed the shogun a rebel,
demanding his immediate surrender; also advised
Tetsutaisho that if he longer refused to submit to
orders from Kyoto he did so at his peril.</p>

<p class="indent">The young commander did not wait for an answer,
but set the day upon which to sail. When the time
came he bid all on land a hearty good-bye, and under
the promise of warm skies and a calm sea spread
canvas; and the southern armada sailed away, toward
its heroic mission and enlarged purpose.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa&#146;s ship had been the last to leave its
moorings, and as it slowly backed off a shout went up
from the throngs who crowded the shore, bringing the
young hero on deck where he bade them all farewell.
Blushing maidens waved their handkerchiefs, while
young men shouted themselves hoarse. Old men
bowed, and white-haired women prophesied. Some
moaned a murmuring fear, for they had heard the
voice of Kammon and seen visions of the mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
dragon of the sea. Nor were those on board the
ships afterwards less apprehensive, for the warm skies
of the early morning had changed to sultry, murky
heat. At midday the sun barely showed its great,
fiery face, and when it had sunk toward the western
horizon the winds ceased and the spangled fleet lay
still on the glassy waters or lolled on the lazy, deep
rolling seas.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus they drifted and wandered far out on the blue
expanse, like tiny specks on the line betwixt heaven
and earth, while their thoughts roamed tauntingly
through weird vagaries of legionary mysticism.
Then suddenly the heavens darkened, the winds
blew, and the seas angered.</p>

<p class="indent">Even Shibusawa became not without a reverence
for the ancestral gods. The cracking of the timbers,
the cries of the drowning, the fear of destruction,
these had certainly been enough to inspire feelings of
respect if not reverence for that which had once been
all and all to him. He came upon deck and there
witnessed the power of religion over men. His oldest
veterans, tried and found true on many a battle-field,
were there lying prostrate before their chosen gods.
He too may have reverenced Bishamon, for he knelt
and remained silent in the momentary calm.</p>

<p class="indent">And as he there bowed a woman arose from the
hatchway before him. He started, and for the nonce
lost his reason, appealing to Kwannon to save them.
His whole soul had returned at the call of the source
whence it came; the body gave what the mind failed.
He felt her presence, and all the reason of all the enlightened
ages could not have shown him that Takara
had not invoked their calamity; for had not the sages
of all time said that the presence of a woman on board
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
a man-of-war would bring upon it the wrath of Oni?
And was it not said there could be no escaping his
fury? These early accounted truths overwhelmed
Shibusawa, and for the moment he crouched in
startled submission. The hobgoblins of his youth had
at last become a stern reality, for there stood before
him his own wife in the flesh and form. He would
have risen and appealed to her, but she checked him;
and coming near, beckoned him be silent, then said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You would believe me a witch, some demon who
has risen from the deep to do you harm. It is not
true; I came to save you.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she drew from her sleeve a blood-stained
handkerchief, which she bade him take from her hand.
Impulse moved him to do so, and as he touched the
crumpled cloth his own consciousness discerned the
awful message therein revealed. He held it and
listened, half bewildered, half determined. She continued,
saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Take it, and promise me that you will avenge the
wrong, that you will sacrifice your own for your
father&#146;s blood?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He started, then hesitated; and looking all around,
asked:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The storm?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">She answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Do you promise?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I do.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the storm broke afresh upon them; her face
brightened, and she leaped over the side of the ship
and into the angry sea; and as she sank beneath the
foam-tossed waves she smiled sweetly, and he felt
and knew her message to be a token of peace.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
As she disappeared from sight Shibusawa rushed to
the ship&#146;s rail, and calling loudly to those about him
threw off his garment and would have leaped after
her had they not seized hold and implored him not to
let them die while he saved only a woman. He threw
them from him and turned to make the leap; but instead
started back and stared in front, for there arose
before him out of the waters a vision of beauty, a
goddess of truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Her beautiful form seemed wound round with a
mist, and her upturned face looked toward the
heavens. The storm ceased and the waters calmed.
The dark clouds parted and a sunburst shone through,
enshrouding her; she soared upward, disappearing
within the sun&#146;s circle; the clouds closed after her, and
she was seen no more; Shibusawa alone knew the
haven of her rest.</p>

<p class="indent">Thence they sailed away toward Hakone, the intended
port of landing. The typhoon which had
passed them did no great damage to the fleet&#151;only
destroying some of the smaller craft and a few thousand
men&#151;and the repairs were soon made, while
they progressed without further interruption.</p>

<p class="indent">After the weather had settled and they were again
under full sail Shibusawa retired to his cabin, and
there pondered deeply the strange scene he had witnessed.
He knew that he had always acted in accordance
with the dictates of his own conscience, and felt
that he could not hold himself accountable for the sad
misfortunes of fate. Yet he remained conscious of
Takara&#146;s new love, and, after having again brushed
aside all trace of returning mysticism, felt a deep
sorrow overspreading his life.</p>

<p class="indent">She, too, had passed through this same consciousness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
and had grown to love Shibusawa better than he
knew; and when the time had come for him to set sail
a great fear had taken hold of her, and she could not
bear to see him go beyond her reach. She had
reasoned well that his duty called him hence and that
at his post there was no place for a woman. Yet she
longed to be near him, to share his sorrows and comfort
his distress.</p>

<p class="indent">All this Takara felt in her heart, though she knew
that he could not return her love; that another held in
secret the trust which God had given, and that she
herself at best must be but a slave. As such, she
stole on board his ship and hid herself away. The
storm came upon them, and she too may have fallen
at the shrine of Mystery, listened to the sweet voice of
Tradition. And she reasoned that if the one be true,
the other must suffice; that if her presence had disturbed
the gods, her sacrifice must appease their
wrath. Hence she sought her god, and intrusted to
him the keeping of her sworn duty. He accepted the
obligation, and she answered to the will of her Maker.
It is asked:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Is the beautiful goddess of truth a certain star?
Is Takara in heaven?&#148;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX<br/>
THE BIVOUAC</h2>

<p class="indent">The armada arrived at Hakone early in the
morning, and the myriad sails stretched for
miles along the low, sand-skirted beach, while the eager
men plunged and waded to the shore. The waters
lay calm&#151;scarcely a ripple stirring their glassy surface&#151;and
long before midnight the soldiers had
bivouacked upon the sloping banks far up toward the
surrounding hills. They slumbered, and only the
slow tramp of the sentinel told of the visitation there
encamped.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa alone lingered; he could not sleep. A
new responsibility had taken hold of him, and his
mind wandered into the mystic land of infinitude. At
his back lay the majestic Fujiyama, whose silent cone
and sloping sides seemed encircled with a thousand
magic tales, and whose lofty peak had inspired with
awe the millions born of departed ages; while before
him spread the plains of Sagami, studded with its
historic legend, sacred temples, mammoth statues,
palaces of the kings, and caves of the gods.</p>

<p class="indent">The restless man thought of all these, and of how
he had rambled amidst its historic fields; climbed up
and into the very heart and head of the great Buddha,
with its eyes of gold and tons of bronze, measuring
fifty feet in height and seventeen across from ear to
ear; stolen on the rock-hewn steps around the jagged
cliffs at Enoshima, where juts the rock and beats the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
surf, to the cave, in which dwells the lovely goddess
Benten; pilgrimaged to the lofty golden-lacquered
statue of Kwannon, the beautiful image, over sixty
feet in height, of the time-honoured goddess of mercy,
recalling that he, too, had stood at her feet, in the
darkened chamber, behind the shrine, bowing with
reverence, while the priests in their sombre gowns
repeated holy incantations: that he had admired the
beautiful handiwork of man as they raised and lowered
the sliding candles from foot to head on either side,
and that he had gone away again feeling better in
heart and stronger of purpose&#151;more fitted to do his
part in the mighty empire of life. These things
crowded upon his memory, and a whole world of
beauty opened up as of the past and he marvelled at
its vastness and shuddered at the thought of its
crumbling before the march of progress. He asked
himself if he were in the right in hastening its downfall;
if all those who had gone before, those millions
of tireless, worshipping souls, had lived in vain.
Then a broader conception dawned, and he answered:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Yes.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">He had looked beyond all this to the God who knows
no image, who counts within His fold all the suns and
moons and stars and lands within a world of worlds.
He then slept, and upon arising despatched a message
to Kyoto with the news of Takara&#146;s death, and began
the march toward Tokyo, much refreshed and more
confident of his mission. He had overcome the last
temptation to cling to the old, and pressed forward
with a better courage and lighter heart toward the
new. He too had loved and lost, though his God bade
him have faith: Takara&#146;s did not.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL<br/>
SIEGE OF TOKYO</h2>

<p class="indent">A slow march of nearly three weeks brought
Shibusawa and his great army to the outskirts
of the shogun&#146;s capital city, Tokyo; little resistance
having been offered on the way, and no considerable
inconvenience suffered.</p>

<p class="indent">The assaulting general had taken his time, partly
because of the difficulty experienced in moving artillery
without a sufficient supply of horses or cattle,
but chiefly in view of expected hostilities and the uncertainty
of the country through which they passed.
However, he was agreeably disappointed in finding
his passage practically uninterrupted, and the inhabitants
not extremely unfriendly. The news had gone
far in advance of his coming, and the very audacity
of his movements had won for him admiration if not
respect.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon arriving at his destination, Shibusawa halted
well outside the city, seized upon the most advantageous
points and fortified them with artillery and troops,
preparatory to the great siege which he had planned.</p>

<p class="indent">In his investment of the place he took particular
pains to make his stand at some considerable distance
from the densely built sections. He had realised the
danger of setting fire to the thatched roofs and wooden
structures, should any heavy engagement take place
near them, and however anxious he may have been to
crush the shogunate he did not wish to do so at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
cost of a conflagration or the needless destruction of
life or property. He went at the business of conquering
the foe with a just and full appreciation of the
rights and conveniences of the people; and, upon extending
his lines around the city, purposely left a
weak place to the northward, giving the enemy a
chance to break through, if he so desired, thus avoiding
the necessity of fighting the final engagement at or
near the great capital, with its large population, its
splendid buildings, and vast stores of wealth.</p>

<p class="indent">In this Shibusawa reasoned well and, under existing
conditions, lost nothing in position or opportunity.
While the loophole came to nothing so far as the shogun
himself was concerned, it did afterwards accomplish
good results by letting at least a portion of the
samurai out, thus avoiding a last stand or any large
engagement within the city. Nor would it have been
any the less operative in the case of Hitotsubashi, had
he not weakened at the first appearance of danger
and run like the weakling he had shown himself to be.
The scared shogun had long since withdrawn from
anything like a hostile attitude, hiding himself within
the secret confines of a bulwark builded by other
hands than his.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, upon the receipt of Shibusawa&#146;s letter, despatched
from Owara, advising him of the mikado&#146;s
edict demanding his resignation, Hitotsubashi fainted
away and was revived only by means of much sorcery
and many assurances. Tetsutaisho had by this time
fully recovered&#151;having suffered more from the
concussion than from the wound&#151;and become anxious
to retrieve his fallen prowess. Before his disablement
at Fushima he had presaged the inevitable
outcome of the battle, had he been spared to lead on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
to victory his overwhelming numbers, and now
keenly felt the disgrace rightly attributed to his idolised
shogun, who had so promptly and properly taken
up the ill-fated command. Therefore, urging Hitotsubashi
to stand firm, he advised that they all fall together
like men, if fall they must.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;True, your most august highness, I advised war
from the beginning,&#148; said he. &#147;I do no less now.
And when the last has deserted, Tetsutaisho will stand
face to face with the enemy. You have my judgment;
I have the army. Do as you will, but I shall defend
these walls, which enclose the last that is dear to a
samurai. Loyalty is my due, and honour my right.
May the gods deal lightly with you; with me there
is a more serious issue: the shogunate must live!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Though the commander-in-chief of the shogun&#146;s
forces held positive in his stand, and was now strongly
supported by both Daikomitsu and Okotsuba, and
several other of the daimyos, he could no longer
bolster up and encourage the waning Hitotsubashi.
On the contrary the latter grew more cowardly and
anxious, and long before Shibusawa had arrived, he,
together with some twenty daimyos and a large
number of retainers and hangers-on, withdrew from
the walled palace, retiring to the castle of Mito in
everlasting disgrace. Their withdrawal necessarily
weakened the triumvirate, but it did still more: it
again divided them in their policy, and scattered them
in their last defence.</p>

<p class="indent">Daikomitsu had in the first place advised Hitotsubashi
to go to Kyoto in compliance with the mikado&#146;s
request, but he had never considered the surrendering
of the shogunate or the abandonment of its cause;
and when the shogun had so flagrantly disregarded his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
advice and marched against Kyoto, he realised more
than ever the necessity of ignoring him, and of establishing
a more harmonious relation among the
triumvirate. This he undertook to do, and had the
shogun remained quietly in the palace at Tokyo they
might yet have succeeded in saving their idolised
institution.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho not only was thus sorely tried with
public duties and loss of prestige, but had been overwhelmed
with sorrow at home. He had there met
with new and bitter experiences and, in place of that
consolation and comfort which a man in any position
can ill afford to forego, was burdened with a deep and
abiding grief.</p>

<p class="indent">Not until the night before the shogun&#146;s departure
had Nehachibana relented; then she came to her husband
and in a confused manner confessed that Kinsan
had not taken the life of Sodachinojoi. She told
him of how the child of itself had slipped into the
crevice; and without making any excuse for her own
falsehood or expressing sympathy for the wronged one,
she left him there, and the next day went out of the
city, following the train of the shogun into seclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Nehachibana had become a convert to the new
religion, and believing herself a martyr now sought to
relieve her conscience by a confession of the facts;
thus preparing herself to ask His forgiveness and
receive salvation. Tetsutaisho&#146;s wife had been an
easy convert and ready worker among her kind; it had
been easy for her to become a Christian, offering a
ready road to happiness; her own religion was not so
easily adjusted or so well suited to like achievement.
And while the missionary, Mrs. Lindley, escaped
along with the shogun&#146;s retinue, and took her convert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
with her, she had done a great good in the years
she had been at Tokyo; for not only had she saved
Nehachibana&#146;s soul, but her little daughter had given
much succour and some comfort to poor Kinsan while
suffering the cruel revenge of her fiendish tormentor.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho&#146;s heart sickened upon hearing the
confession; and hastening to rectify the awful mistake,
he found Kinsan suffering all but the last pangs of
starvation; for the attention even of the missionary&#146;s
little daughter had in the excitement of the hour
failed her. The strong man fell upon his knees at her
side, and with his own hands broke the lock which
held the vile instrument at her neck. Gathering the
frail form in his arms he carried her to her former
lodge, and there summoned the best aid and nourishment
at his command. Nor was he satisfied with
this alone, but would have condemned Nehachibana
even to a severer punishment had not Kinsan pleaded
for her deliverance, saying feebly:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She is but a woman; and no more accountable for
her way than I am for my misfortune. It is not the
deed, but the necessity that makes the wrong. In
such an one there can be no crime&#151;please do not
inflict a punishment.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho yielded to Kinsan&#146;s persuasion, for he
now understood her, and appreciated the force of her
intent, though not her logic. He remained a child of
feudalism, and outside its tenets was a suckling, not
knowing that there opened another way. To him
woman seemed but an instrument, the better used to
gratify man&#146;s desire; and when he allowed Nehachibana
to escape it had been only to encourage an eager,
selfish hope.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan recovered rapidly; thus Tetsutaisho became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
relieved, and devoted himself more than ever to the
strengthening of his defences and the preparations for
a final combat. In his mind there was only one course
to pursue, and that the heroic. It mattered not that
a city be destroyed, that countless lives be sacrificed.
He was as bold and intrepid as he was loyal and
courageous; knowing neither the power of deception,
nor the force of heartless mechanism. He marshalled
not their cowardly virtues, but called to hand an
humbler host, the glorious heroics of a dying age.
He proposed to make a last triumphant stand,
and dazzle mankind with the splendour of his
achievement; but in this, too, he was doomed to
disappointment.</p>

<p class="indent">Both Daikomitsu and Okotsuba reasoned patiently
against the dangers of his policy. They knew too
well the futility of matching valour against cunning,
the human against the inhuman. They argued well
that they had best make good their escape, holding
the enemy in check and preserving their own forces
until, in time, they could substitute a more effective
warfare. But Tetsutaisho remained resolute and
when the final day came, faced a hopeless attempt,
realising only at the last moment the inevitable consequence
of his folly.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a dark, gloomy, and hopeless day. All the
morning the rain had poured, and the thatched roofs
and wooden structures were soaked with water. The
time was July&#151;the fourth day&#151;and after the long
rain a rising vapour enveloped the city with a low,
hazy fog. The clouds overhead ran low, and Shibusawa
ordered the advance. Twice before he had
planned to move upon them, but each time refrained
from doing so at the earnest appeal of Daikomitsu,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
who had sent messengers protesting against
the destruction of the city. This time there must be
no halting; the heavens had cleared the way.</p>

<p class="indent">Column after column of the mikado&#146;s splendid
army, with fixed bayonet and steady march, advanced
from the south upon the walled enclosure at the
palace grounds. Hardly had they sounded the approach,
the moats were destroyed and the big cannon
hurled their easy missiles against the yielding gates
and weakening walls. The waters emptied, and the
stones loosened and fell; they pressed on, some levelling,
others scaling, until the last obstruction had
fallen&#151;thus thrice proving the certainty of the new
and the futility of the old, as time and progress ever
repeat.</p>

<p class="indent">As the last wall fell Shibusawa brandished high his
sword and commanded the charge. Quickly they ran,
and the hillside swarmed with oncoming hordes of
sturdy, determined men. Reaching the summit the
broad expanse of the shogun&#146;s gardens spread out
before them, and they ranked in double line, listening,
with breathless expectation. And as they waited
the clouds parted, revealing a scattering enemy in the
background; only a small formation stood aligned in
front of the palace buildings. Like a flash came the
order:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Fire!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">A blaze, and the crack of musketry dulled against
the heavy atmosphere. The line fell to their knees
and began reloading. The rear had risen, and stood
ready to repeat. The smoke rose, and a woman was
seen running toward them. She had gained the
centre of the field, yet without heed of her presence
or time to observe an order a second volley poured its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
deadly shot into the foreground. Shibusawa had seen
her and cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Cease your firing!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">But the warning had come too late, and turning to
his troops he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Would you so little respect the helpless, and that a
woman? I thought better of my command. Hold
you here with compassion, and let me advance.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor had he checked their progress unknowingly;
for before the smoke again shut out the view he had
levelled his glasses at the approaching form, and to
his horror discovered that it was Kinsan who with the
white cloth in hand had reeled and fallen before the
wicked report had time to die away.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa at the head of his staff sprang forward,
and before the smoke had again fairly cleared away
came well-nigh upon the fallen woman who lay in a
swoon, though breathing lightly and not mortally
wounded. But not he alone had gone to her rescue,
for Tetsutaisho also had observed her danger, and
from the opposite side ran to save her. At the beginning
of the engagement Kinsan and others had been
carefully sheltered at the rear, from which situation
she overheard a heated discussion between Tetsutaisho
and Daikomitsu, resulting in the latter&#146;s withdrawal
at the last moment of the major portion of the samurai,
leaving scarcely more than Tetsutaisho&#146;s bodyguard
with which to defend himself and the palace.
Fearing his fate, Kinsan had without bidding or warning
evaded them all, seeking to stay her master&#146;s
destruction by throwing herself in front. She knew
that Tetsutaisho, reduced to a handful of patriots,
could not withstand the terrible onslaught of a mighty
army, and offered to sacrifice herself in the hope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
saving him in some way from ruthless destruction, if
not ignominious defeat. Her heart had gone out to
him and to the few others who had remained steadfast
to principle, and her life seemed to her of slight
importance as compared with theirs, or in prolonging,
even momentarily, the institution which had given
them place.</p>

<p class="indent">Tetsutaisho, too, had run out in advance of his
guard, and coming up felt relieved to know that
Kinsan had not been fatally shot. Halting near by,
as did Shibusawa, the two met face to face, measuring
the inevitable.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa, the conqueror, spoke first; it became
not him to humble the vanquished. Speaking
kindly yet firmly, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;What would you, Tetsutaisho?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;I am a samurai, Shibusawa.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You have answered well, Tetsutaisho, and Shibusawa
is none the less a man.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">They drew their swords&#151;Tetsutaisho, the one
that Munechika had died in the forging; Shibusawa,
the Murakumo which had not once failed the illustrious
Maidos. The guards stood umpire in the background.
The clouds parted and the sun shone forth
a pale red. Their steels rang with the perfection of
their making. Kinsan rose upon one arm and humbly
raised the other in silent deprecation. Then she
turned her face and sank back upon the cool, damp
ground. The two giants did not heed her; they were
facing death, and the test already quickened.</p>

<p class="indent">They fought without an error. Twice the swarthy
Tetsutaisho forced the nimble Shibusawa to the
ground, but each time a quicker eye and better mind
saved him the fall. They fought fiercely, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
blood-stained grass told of their deliberate purpose.
A calm settled around them; no other sound could be
heard. The mighty frame of the one pressed hard;
a frown crossed his face, and he parried heavily. Shibusawa&#146;s
muscles set and his eyes flashed. Then
there came a clash and a thrust, and Tetsutaisho fell
prostrate, with a broken sword at his side.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinsan feebly turned toward them. Tetsutaisho
partly rose, and beckoned the victor approach. Shibusawa
came near, and Kinsan faintly heard the dying
man&#146;s last words:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;She is innocent!&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa bent over Kinsan and asked her forgiveness.
She only smiled; then he took her in his
arms and carried her away. It was not far, but
chanced to be to the hidden cave, which lay behind
the lines just below the hill near by. There he called
for relief and her wound was dressed. When she
looked about and saw the place she felt her great
love, and knew that his had been born anew.</p>

<p class="indent">After Shibusawa had been fully informed as to the
nature of Kinsan&#146;s wound he ordered the army held
in check, and directed that she be carried to his own
castle just below the grounds, where Maido, his
father, had lived and served so long the power that
he himself had now overcome and forever destroyed.
There he found the busy Shiyoganai still in charge,&#151;Okyo
had disappeared,&#151;and after providing Kinsan
with every comfort and the best skill at his command
Shibusawa despatched a message and escort for his
sister Yasuko, who had remained behind at the castle
in Kanazawa, urging her to come quickly, so that she
might relieve him of the immediate care of Kinsan.</p>

<p class="indent">He had learned that her breast was pierced through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
with a bullet, and that while the wound was not necessarily
a dangerous one it would be many months
before she could be expected fully to recover, even
under the most favourable circumstances. He therefore
confined his further war-like operations to Tokyo
and the immediate vicinity, returning to her each day
until his sister had arrived and replaced him with a
more useful, if not kinder attention. Nor was Yasuko
unhappy for the chance, but applied herself with a
devotion that disclaimed any thought of stoicism or
even indifference. She expressed a true type of the
generations that had gone before her, and did not
falter nor shrink from her part; she loved her brother,
and believed his every wish worthy of her unquestioned
attention.</p>

<p class="indent">And she not only nursed the sick one, but so devoted
herself to the house that when Shibusawa
finally returned he found the old home bubbling over
with such joys as he had never before known.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI<br/>
THE RESTORATION</h2>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa had no sooner provided for Kinsan&#146;s
temporary comfort than he hastened to
resume his command. The halt in his progress had
given Daikomitsu time to withdraw the rebellious
samurai in order and hastily prepare a cover for his
retreat.</p>

<p class="indent">After having induced the hesitating troops to abandon
Tetsutaisho, Daikomitsu had found himself
necessarily pressed into their command. In consequence
he withdrew from the palace grounds, and
taking a temporary stand at Uyeno park undertook,
with a small detachment, to check Shibusawa&#146;s
advance until, with the main body of the samurai, he
had fought his way through the enemy&#146;s line to the
northward.</p>

<p class="indent">It had grown late in the day by the time Shibusawa
had completed his investment of the palace and resumed
the advance. The lateness of the hour
proved greatly to Daikomitsu&#146;s advantage; so much so
that when the mikado&#146;s troops reached Uyeno they
were unable to dislodge the enemy, but met with such
resistance as to check their advance until the following
morning. Each assault had been sharp but decisive,
and every attempt met with positive repulse.
The loss of life was great and to the surprise of both
sides proved to be nearly equal.</p>

<p class="indent">Though the battle of Uyeno has ever been accounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
a victory for the mikadate, Daikomitsu had cleared
the way, and under cover of night marched through
the enemy&#146;s lines toward Hakadata in the north. In
the meantime Okotsuba had withdrawn the rebel
fleet and proceeded on his way to the same place,
where they again joined forces and later gained a
signal victory over Shibusawa and his modernised
army, who had followed hot in pursuit.</p>

<p class="indent">They were, however, soon doomed to entire defeat,
and upon their final surrender both Daikomitsu and
Okotsuba were brought back to Tokyo, and in consideration
of their faithfulness and humanitarianism
given liberty. The doom of the shogunate had been
sounded with the fall of Tetsutaisho, and no power
afterwards could have saved their final and complete
overthrow.</p>

<p class="indent">The news of the great victory of July 4th soon
reached Kyoto, and the mikado began making preparations
to remove to Tokyo. Without needless delay
he started thither, and upon his arrival proclaimed
himself emperor of Japan, changed the capital city to
Tokyo, and promulgated the constitution as promised:
Shibusawa had gained the liberty to marry whom he
chose, and he lost no time in so doing.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon his return from the north he was offered the
highest place in the gift of the emperor, but declining
with the utmost respect, Shibusawa chose to become
a private citizen; the emperor excusing him only upon
his earnest personal request, trusting to his loyalty
for the necessary and proper readjustment. Accordingly,
Shibusawa forthwith called a meeting of all the
daimyos, at which Kido was named mediator; a memorandum
being drafted and signed, without a dissenting
voice, wherein they declared their willingness to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
surrender to the new government their titles, their
fiefs, and their arms.</p>

<p class="indent">The emperor promptly accepted their resignations
and promulgated what is known as the Patriotic Act,
whereby those who chose were retitled and all reimbursed
according to the value of their respective
estates.</p>

<p class="indent">Shibusawa remained a loyal subject and settled at
the capital city, in the old castle under the hill which
had for centuries been the home of his ancestors and
a pride to the once glorious but now departed court.
Here he gathered around him the loyal and the faithful.
Others were pensioned or rewarded, and none
was dissatisfied. Kinsan had recovered, and the
quaint halls once more echoed to the sound of marriage
bells. There were a host to do him honour, and
a world to keep them faithful, while no sorrow of the
past shadowed their future. The prattle of children,
the song of a mother, and the solicitude of a father
graced their home and cheered their lives, making the
battle worth the victory.</p>

<p class="indent">They lived as they had hoped, a blessing came as
the reward of their faith, and whether in the social
hall or before the footboards of the great Donjero:
though at toil in the world or at rest in the home,
they had found peace, the brightest jewel in the crown
of life.</p>

<p class="h2">APPENDIX</p>

<blockquote class="blockquotsm">
<p class="indent"><b>Nearly all Japanese words should be spoken without accent, or, rather, with
a slight and equal accent upon each syllable. The pronunciation should begin
with a perceptible force, which gradually softens to the last, through a quick succession
of all the syllables.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><b>1</b>. <b><a href="#fn1">Nippon</a><a name="index1" id="index1"></a></b> (N&#301;p-p&#466;n). This was the Japanese name for
Japan, though foreigners had always confined or limited its
use to the name of the largest island, or mainland, of the
Japanese archipelago.</p>

<p class="indent">To those who are familiar with things Japanese the sound
of this name carries a special significance, for in it are wrapped
the origin and growth of Japanese life, its religion, customs,
traditions, and beliefs.</p>

<p class="indent">Their history covers an unbroken reign, the longest of any
progressive people now on earth, so far as we know, and their
version of the Creation contains a principle that is pre-eminently
theirs; for Shintoism knows only Japan. Their
religion, like the Christian with Christians, is co-extensive
with their history; each beginning the record, as do all others,
at its separation from myth.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn2">2</a><a name="index2" id="index2"></a></b>. <b>Daimyo</b> (d&#299;-m&#301;-&#333;-). The highest official in a province
under the shogunate. By way of comparison, his position
might be said to have corresponded to that of governor of
a state in America, though his powers and duties were very
dissimilar. The title originated under the mikadate, but
from necessity as well as policy the daimyos generally became
allied with the shogunate, hence in fact a part of it.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn3">3</a><a name="index3" id="index3"></a></b>. <b>Shogun</b> (sh&#333;-g&#365;n). The official head of the shogunate
(one of the dual sides, or heads, of the Japanese government)
which was established in the twelfth century, and lasted until
abolished in 1868.</p>

<p class="indent">From the beginning of recorded Japan until the twelfth
century the mikado was the sole ruler, both spiritual and
temporal, and during the latter part of his reign, as such,
the shogun existed, but only as an inferior: the commander-in-chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
of the mikado&#146;s armies. Thus intrenched behind
the military forces the shogun became enabled to enlarge his
powers, and finally forcibly made the office hereditary, and
himself secure in the material rule of the empire.</p>

<p class="indent">Satisfied with temporal supremacy the shogunate never
attempted to encroach upon the mikado&#146;s spiritual distinction,
as ever held by the people. Nor was it alone policy
that so long prompted a continuance of this dual form of
government, but it was the ruling spirit quite as much of the
shogunate as of the people at large. This has been repeatedly
denied&#151;in fact, it has been denied that there ever was
actually two heads of government&#151;but the facts hardly
justify any such conclusion. Brushing aside all technicalities,
a brilliant and polite administration of upwards of a
thousand years stands out in its dual capacity as distinctly
as do the two sister planets, and if that is not sufficient to
establish authenticity as such then man must be at a loss
to comprehend what constitutes the right of recognition.</p>

<p class="indent">There was, in fact, a dual form of government: the one
head, the mikado, spiritual; the other, the shogun, material&#151;each
in its sphere, as related to a homogeneous whole. By
a compromise these two were, in 1868, merged into one&#151;the
empire&#151;with a discontinuance of the shogunate, and
a continuance of the mikadate line of succession as the sole,
reigning emperor. (See No. 9, Mikado.)</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn4">4</a><a name="index4" id="index4"></a></b>. <b>Kimono</b> (k&#301;-m&#333;-n&#333;). The outer, or principal garment
worn by the Japanese, both male and female.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn5">5</a><a name="index5" id="index5"></a></b>. <b>Harakiri</b> (há-rá-kâ-râ). An honourable method of committing
suicide under the shogunate. It was generally done
under an official decree of death, and performed by cutting
or ripping open the belly with a sharp knife or dirk.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn6">6</a><a name="index6" id="index6"></a></b>. <b>Koto</b> (k&#333;-t&#333;). A kind of harp, or stringed instrument
used in Japan, more for the production of classic music.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn7">7</a><a name="index7" id="index7"></a></b>. <b>Geisha</b> (g&#299;-sh&#551;). A professional singer or musician of
the female sex, who sings or plays for hire, at both private
and public functions.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn8">8</a><a name="index8" id="index8"></a></b>. <b>Etas</b> (&#275;t-&#462;s). The &#147;unclean&#148;; such as grave-diggers,
etc.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn9">9</a><a name="index9" id="index9"></a></b>. <b>Mikado</b> (m&#365;-k&#551;-d&#333;). The official head of the Japanese,
both spiritual and temporal, from the beginning until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
twelfth century, when the shogun rose to power and seized
the material functions of government.</p>

<p class="indent">Thence a dual form ensued, the mikado remaining the
spiritual and the shogun the temporal ruler until 1868, when
both were merged into the empire, with the mikado&#146;s line
reigning as emperor. The office of shogun was then abolished.
(See No. 3, Shogun.)</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn10">10</a><a name="index10" id="index10"></a></b>. <b>Joro</b> (j&#333;-r&#333;). A woman who for hire submits herself
to the practice of sexual intercourse, in accordance with
custom and law. When done under stress of circumstances,
such as the financial aid of a distressed parent, it was deemed
a virtue, and the participant, except for the time being, did
not lose caste, but when the contract time had elapsed
(usually three years) was received by her friends and the
community as a sort of martyr.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn11">11</a><a name="index11" id="index11"></a></b>. <b>Kakemono</b> (k&#462;-k&#275;-m&#333;-n&#333;). The predominant Japanese
picture used for decorating the walls of a house. It is
usually painted, or scrolled upon a long, narrow piece of silk
or sheet of paper, and mounted upon a roller. Its use is
similar to that of the ordinary European framed picture,
and it was the means of expressing their highest art in painting
and writing.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn12">12</a><a name="index12" id="index12"></a></b>. <b>Kuge</b> (koo-g&#462;). A class, consisting of nobles and
members of the former mikado&#146;s court.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn13">13</a><a name="index13" id="index13"></a></b>. <b>Ronin</b> (r&#333;-n&#301;n). At first an organized band of disaffected
patriots, but afterwards a malcontented clan who
held themselves in readiness, for hire or otherwise, to commit
some depredation upon organised society, or its members.
The Band of Forty-Seven have been much written about in
prose and poetry.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn14">14</a><a name="index14" id="index14"></a></b>. <b>Bakufu</b> (b&#551;-koo-foo). A class consisting of retainers
and members of the shogun&#146;s court.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn15">15</a><a name="index15" id="index15"></a></b>. <b>Samisen</b> (s&#551;-m&#299;-s&#283;n). A stringed musical instrument
resembling something between a banjo and a guitar. It is
commonly used by the geishas, and is popular with the
lower classes.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn16">16</a><a name="index16" id="index16"></a></b>. <b>Kokyu</b> (k&#333;-ky-&#363;). A kind of musical instrument.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn17">17</a><a name="index17" id="index17"></a></b>. <b>Sayonara</b> (s&#299;-y&#333;-n&#462;-r&#551;). The Japanese for &#147;good-bye.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn18">18</a><a name="index18" id="index18"></a></b>. <b>Koku</b> (k&#333;-koo). A unit of measure, whose degree of
value varied with time and locality.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
<b><a href="#fn19">19</a><a name="index19" id="index19"></a></b>. <b>Hinin</b> (h&#301;-n&#301;n). The vile; such as slaughterers, beggars,
etc. At one time they were by law made social outcasts.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn20">20</a><a name="index20" id="index20"></a></b>. <b>Obi</b> (&#333;-b&#301;). A kind of sash, or girdle, worn about the
waist for convenience and ornament.</p>

<p class="indent"><b><a href="#fn21">21</a><a name="index21" id="index21"></a></b>. <b>Yamabushi</b> (yá-má-boo-sh&#301;). Mendicant monks.</p>
